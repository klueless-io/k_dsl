# {{titleize microapp.settings.application}}

> {{safe description}}

This GEM is inspired by the Javascript Library [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers).

I am following a lot of the categories found there, but this GEM is not a one for one match to the existing JS library as I feel it is a bit dated and could use some new helpers and categories may be relevant today.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem '{{microapp.settings.application}}'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install {{microapp.settings.application}}
```

## Development

Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone {{project.config.github.user}}/{{microapp.settings.application}}
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Handlebars::Helpers::Template.render('{{curly-open 2}}camel .}}', 'david was here')
# => "DavidWasHere"
Handlebars::Helpers::Template.render('{{curly-open 2}}dasherize .}}', 'david was here')
# => "david-was-here"
```

`{{microapp.settings.application}}` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, build the gem and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```bash
gem build
gem push rspec-usecases-?.?.??.gem
# or push the latest gem
ls *.gem | sort -r | head -1 | xargs gem push
```
