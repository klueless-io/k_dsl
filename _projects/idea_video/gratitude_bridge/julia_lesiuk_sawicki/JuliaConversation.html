<div class='bubble david '>Hey Julia, looks like you had a great night.  Every time I saw you, you were on the dance floor .maybe we can dance another night.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes defiantly, I had a ball, so many different styles, I have so much to learn, I look forward to the next time we see each other on the dance floor.oxo</div>

<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you for the dances David , I had a really fun time and appreciate, your tips and counting me through it helped me a lot.

If you ever what some dance tips or help,  just ask, I'm happy to help
But if all you want is fun dancing. Happy for that too</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>As an artist I'm happy, but never satisfied, Always finding ways to improve in any craft I undertake. Would love your help and how you helped last night was great.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Cool. Just seek me out at the dance venue's and especially when its quiet i will just do some training runs with you
Just doing 1 or 2 songs with just training should be enough to advance you a fair bit
Then take to the social floor with different people for practice
My phone is about to run out of charge. If i don't reply that is why</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David, I'm so glad I have met you, see you on the dance floor. Have a great week. Julia</div>

Sorry about talking about my divorce stuff, I promised myself not to do that, just felt a bit exhausted, I value our friendship and thank you for your help, you are a brilliant dancer and I trust your expertise and advise, I will learn the fundamental foundation first and then layer my own expression one that  is done otherwise my salsa dancing will get messy and wild like the man dancing with Wolves , have a great Easter love Julia</div>

I also value your friendship, please don't worry about talking about your divorce stuff, I'm a good listener.
Have a good yoga retreat and when you get back, maybe we can spend a little bit of time just having some simple 15 minute practice sessions.

<div class='bubble david '>I saw the couple of hundred tribal pictures you posted on pinterest today
have fun up there</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I didn't realise Pinterest  was posting on Facebook, transition research ha ha</div>

<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia, how are you</div>
</div>
<h2>04-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hey I'm good, what type exercise did you decide to go with?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I have not fully decided, but for now I am leaning towards kung fu
I don't thinkg I'm strong enough for yoga yet
and I really want to take a longer term approach and increase my strenght over time</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's good, well Iv decided to do a course in drumming</div>
<div class='bubble david '>learning the drums as an instrument or more about tribal drumming?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Tribal</div>
<div class='bubble david '>that would seem really good for you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm drawn towards a more earthier exspression</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can see that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I went to the Anglican Church yesterday , big mistake !</div>
<div class='bubble david '>hmmm, what was that for?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just loving the community vibe and they had separate activities for kids, the sermon was about divorce and how a woman cannot marry another man a Christian faith unless her husband has died</div>
<div class='bubble david '>are you Anglican?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I felt like shit after, no Catholic
I think I'll stick to my drum</div>
<div class='bubble david '>here is my take on the sort of control that I see religion likes to sell
Relegion is for people who don't want to go to Hell.
Spirituality is for people who know what Hell is
Drumming is very spiritual
its all about heart with drumming</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah they break you down then offer courses and mentoring , it's just a business</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I tend to agree</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep and I think I'll learn to hear the tempo of salsa a lot better with it.
I'm planning to merge a bit of both</div>
<div class='bubble david '>though personally while I'm not for religion, I don't have anything truly against them as I think there can be great messages from religious teaching, I just feel that as soon as some one is trying to dictate how I SHOULD live, they have already missed the most fundamental aspect of spirituality
thats a really good idea</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes I agree</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am thinking of merging my salsa in the direction of kizoomba</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Cool I need to see what that is like</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I want to be able to have the fun of salsa with the personal connection of kizoomba
I have some music that you might like the feel off</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm free Tuesday night anything happening salsa wise</div>

<div class='bubble david '>I'm also happy i danced with you after Juan.  It was good for me to hear you saying i was to strong
You need to have the contrast sometimes to know when something is not quite right</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It felt like he was just feeling my body movement lightly touching like in the workshop , my tourso and shoulders, he then understood my body's movement that's when I felt totally comfortable and I trusted him, he could done pretty much anything to me as he was gentle and he had a sense and understanding of my body before starting to do bigger moves, full on connection baby it was great
I have to work now talk later good night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Work Julia I'll be home an hour from mow. Connect if you want then otherwise good night</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Cool
David
Good night David
April 11</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia, I hope you have a wonderful week
Here is a little poem that I found about dance
I am afraid of how this one might end
it's almost like my decisions might be my friend
If I play my weary hand just right
I might be happy for all my life
Yet still there is uncertainty About what my future will be
Will it be mine? Pure happiness?
Or will I never see her long white dress?
Will I ever take her from the isle if I miss this chance?
I think I couldn't I know I wouldn't. So I'll ask her Would you like to dance?</div>
</div>
<h2>11-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Beautiful David, good morning and thank you for the poem, "That's what it's all about", Dance is a beautiful and so thing when over thought can stuff it up, when I get tired I start overthinking and my mind fills with crap and my dancing also becomes crappy , I'm going to try after last nights workshop to approach anyone regardless of there style and see if I'm able to let go, not worry about the steps and not over think but go with there flow, and listen to the music for a change , have a great week ??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good to see you growing in your dance Julia TC</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I love it so much
TC to you to</div>
<div class='bubble david '>maybe we can do a single dance of Kizoomba, (I'm not so crash hot at it) but give you a feeling for it, just seeing the way you dance, I think you would appreciate Kizoomba
on wednesday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It's at 9pm</div>
<div class='bubble david '>actually, yes, that would be best, doing the 9pm beginners kizoomba, it would introduce you
but I was actually suggesting just a social dancer, but if you want to try the classes</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm going to have early nights this week with work so not sure let me see how things are my mums really sick and I want to get home ASAP Julia</div>

April 20
I�m sending you this text first thing in the morning, not to say good morning but to make you smile the second you see this.
Have a wonderful day with your kids, your art and your rehearsals.
I want to let you know that I woke with these perfect photos in my mind.
One was looking upwardly with you standing on last nights park bench, the full moon casting you in a warm glow.
Another was holding you in my arms and drawing in all the delicate features of your pretty face.
The last was just walking hand in hand with you.
These were were the memories that brought a smile to my face upon awakening.
Have a lovely day Julia xo</div>
</div>
<h2>20-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>That is so beautiful David thank you for sharing I'm so keen to see what comes to me during meditation, have a wonderful day ??????
Going with the flow and following my intuition is key, I'm choosing to follow a spiritual path David and I'm inviting you into my sacred space as I trust you will honour this, I have noticed that you are very good in tactics, and mindful of everyone's feelings, as I have Experienced  with my past relationship everyone has a dark side I have seen my dark side and I know what I am capable of an so have you, I can see glimmers of it on a occasions , I understand I am healing I am choosing the light?????? with love no fear, and following my intuition my body and intuition is telling me to be close to you at this moment in my life. Don't control me or override me following my spiritual path as this will be of no service and our journey together will end. That what I got from my meditation David Have a beautiful day. ?? no fear, like the slogan on your t shirt you wore last night.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I love the insight you seem to achieve through your daily meditations and feel blessed that you invite me into your sacred space (no matter how limited that may be right now).
I think of you as being part of my inner circle, and now part of my intimate circle, I look forward to sharing more of myself with you and coming to know you Julia.
I too have a dark side. I have been sending love too to it for some time now but I have a certain amount of healthy fear around my dark side as well, I say this not to frighten you, but more to let you know that I have my own demons that I'm gradually taming and in some ways learning that much of my strength comes from them.
"Don't control me or override me following my spiritual path as this will be of no service and our journey together will end", I hear you Julia
I'm grateful to have spent some time in the sunlight of your spirit. Have a lovely day Julia xo</div>

Free movement and exspression of the heart</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I would live Julia,  i am acting secretary at a meeting in Kirribilli on Friday nights while my mate is traveling overseas
Im pre booked for the next 2 Fridays</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No worries, free masons?
Ha ha
Oops it is sorry</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Question for you
Just because I wont to know your answer
If you could ask a single person one question, and they had to answer truthfully, who and what would you ask?
They dont need to be alive</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Let me think on that whilst I staple my 300 brochures tonight and get back to you,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Deal</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I would ask the little girl from my printmaking workshop, who gave her the black eye</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You are sad about that situation</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>See it to often, hear it to often</div>
<div class='bubble david '>What fear prevented you from asking on the day</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I did ask, she did not want to tell me.
Just wrote a whole lot of stuff that I have deleted, messaging is not the best way to communicate somethings</div>
<div class='bubble david '>If you want to talk i can call you
Not sure if you are busy with prepations for tomorrow</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes busy trying to get some stuff done , want to go to bed as I always get a bit melancholy when tired , I'm booking in to councillor when I get back from Cairns, just a process David I need to go through I have been through trauma before a few times I know the deal</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Well i let you do you thing tonight
Flyers are looking great
I am going to bed very soon ao i will connect in the morning</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>In a deay of ups and downs you bring a joy to my soul
I guess that's how i get the flutters that you talk about</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Bed is calling me to good night David
April 21</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning tiny dancer.
I was thinking about last nights message from you being melancholy.
I know you have traumas, I feel your sadness when a little girl comes to your class with a bruise on her eye, I've noticed your anger over the thought of men trying to control you.
I tend to believe that "you GROW through what GO through"
I think you have a rare and wonderful array of qualities. I see your strength and resilience, I love your femininity and playfulness, I feel your compassion and worry and I'm inspired by your purpose, your drive, your why.
Have a wonderful day Julia xo</div>
</div>
<h2>21-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, one question for you , what is your definition of "dating"?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia
Interesting of question, I don't think I have a fixed definition, I guess in the past it has been going out on dates (doing things with different someone, a movie, picnic, dinner etc..)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hmmm
I have never done it, and I think I would like to try this until I'm legitimately single.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>is that something you want to try with different people? or is that something you want to try with me?
I have no worries around your response, please speak without fear</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes I think I'll try this concept with different people and you if you want to invite me on a date. as I feel this may have been my down fall in previous relationships I give so openly and trust so soon my soul, spirt heart.
I need to get to know someone by dating first before I can go further, as for my tummy thing I need to learn to just deal with that in my own way and be strong about it. I am a passionate woman and have a huge amount of energy, my lesson now is to learn to control that. To learn to disperse this energy to different groups and all of it to one,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I would love to take you on a date (or a few ;)
I understand that you also need to explore who you are with others
I would not want to change that about you
but you need to know, I will fight for you as well
well at the moment, I still don't know you enough
but what I do know is amazing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I am so happy, thank you David, dating seems like a good thing for me now, as I think anything else will be destructive and messy ??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah, I understand, can I let you know that I too am passionate
I say that because I also go deeply into relationships and often to fast for my own good
its interesting sending messages to you because on one hand I want to develop something special with you and on the other hand I don't want to loose myself in the process
I know that I'm a hopeless romantic and that's not always a good thing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Gotta go David and stick my hands in some clay, have a great day ??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>take care Juli
Julia xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just to let you know the different coloured hearts represent the different coloured chakras, green is the the colour of the heart chakra

<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning. Thank you David. I was dreaming of you last night , ??</div>

<h2>22-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>So little sleep for me again. At least I  don't need to be anywhere till the festival starts. Going to try and sleep in
Good morning beautiful xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Im sorry I woke you, I'll send this message in a Few hrs so you can sleep just writing after my meditation and realise that last night I had took on my friends fearful energy from me, light she had haunted my spirit for you, making me doubtful , just shows the power and influence of negative energy.
Kana has a lot of experience with this negativity from others  in the work she does ,as an intuitive worker she meditates a few times a day, especially after some meeting and described to me that she sometimes literally had to spew the negativity out of her body, to then be able to tap in  clearly again.
I also had dinner with Peter and Sebastian last night for the first time, wonderful to see Sebastian but Peter did his usual control shit by arriving half an hr later than the agreed time and as he had changed the locks on the door I had to wait outside, anyway I will ask Karan about her meditation in purging negativity from others.
I hope you rest well boil some fresh ginger in water and a little honey to help with you chest I'll also give you a reiki helping and massage. When we have the right space to do it in xo??
Thank you for the fleets they are so beautiful ??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I would love to chat wirh you about your message above.  Next time we are hanging out bring into the conversation this idea of taking on someone else's negative energy
FYI your message did not wake me. I think my phone is silent at night. I just did my natural wake-up which is usually 5.53 but of late has been happening around 5. I think because of the daylight savings change over.
Receiving a message from you on awakening brings me happiness and your messages after meditation are particularly beautiful
I realize why I have had trouble going to sleep lately
Dance, Facebook, excitement and any other thing at the end of the night can make it hard to sleep but specifically what I have been doing that has hindered my sleeping is
I have been visualizing laying in bed with you in my arms. Sometimes your back to me sometimes your facing me
I've been kissing you and touching and caressing you and before I know it I'm wide awake
I don't know why you do this to me but I am really happy around you Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My tummy and I feel happy around you to????
Have a a lovely day David my mum loves the flowers, she said he's obviously not Polish because they always give carnations. Ha ha</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Do they. I have a place near you where i would normally get flowers because the roses are organic and full of fragrance but this was a rush job. Those roses a re commercial and so while they look pretty .i had to pair them with  the lillies so that there would be a fragrance
You are worth the best

April 23
Morning David just completed my practice meditation, it was a learning experience for me, first times as well in areas. Good to asses reflect understand and move forward with the things that resonate with me to send me forward on my chosen path.
Firstly I'm glad to have finally given you a massage, so many weeks ago with the first discussion at Argyle after my retreat, I had said that is all that I am comfortable in giving to you and keep to enjoying a dance together whilst I heal .
I like the idea of dating but I feel you really want to go further, I don't . Not with both of our living arrangements and I was feeling that jumping in the boot of my car is not something I want to be doing,
I'm a 39 year old woman who has created an amazing life for my self with hard work and perseverance both mentally physically I have friends and family who have incredible love and respect for what I have been through with grace and honour of myself and my son. I'm a spiritual being that has touched people's lives and I woul like to continue giving in this way, my vibration draws people to me that resonate with me.
I live a life of passion and do what I passionately love to do.
It is dance only that ignites my spiritual fire and last night clarified my understanding of this, and also how I feel comfortable in moving diets with our relationship , see you at the Festival David????</div>
</div>
<h2>23-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia, glad you had a great night at moon dance.
You are right in your assessment of how things are. On one hand, I do want more than what you want to give right now and on the other hand neither of us in a place to even do that effectively.
I honor your truth that are in a healing and transition stage of your life.
The reality is that I am too and I should continue working on my foundation. I have just never met someone who inspires me the way you do.
I would like to continue our relationship as friends, as dance partners,  as spiritual beings
I hope also that you are up for some dates with me.
The reason I ask this is because while timing is not right for us  (and may never be) I would like to continue exploring the connection we have.
It may be that you and I meeting is only for specific reason or for a season but also know that there is a spark between us and given time it may be enough to ignite something truly special.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Moving forward not diet
Yes truly happy with that! you seduce me and inspire me with dance, and Dating sounds like fun it would be nice to have one and trust you to take the lead on that as well like in dance as I seem to fuck things up in those areas when I take the lead in dance and dating , ha ha</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thank you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Big lessons for me to learn and I'm thankful for your patience</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am thankful that you are in my life even in such a small way. I find it hard to put into words the beauty and power I see when i look into you. It's like I have struck a nuget of gold but intuitively kniw that it is a limitless mother lode</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Anyway as directed for Bachata performance group dress code, I'm gonna get my fake tan on and fake eye lashes pink nail polish on and lippy , yuk !! What is it with that get up? Who's it for ? I will find the answer in the next couple of day David</div>

Dear Diary, day 21 and I find Julia to be a simply wonderful, I wonder how long this will go on for, no one can be this perfect ,  I wonder when i will see the dark side of her,  what could she be hiding.  Maybe she loves the Kardasians ... Secretly sends money to the Donald Trump campaign ... maybe she has never seen star wars episode IV ... well diary i sleep another day grateful for knowing Julia.
Good night Diary, Good night Beautiful xo

<h2>27-04-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I use my app for my yoga practice and I try and have an uninterrupted practice as part of my healing and figuring things
Just trying to do my meditation now
David give me my time pleas</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I will just send you a big Bear hug and love and let you find clarity for the day.  Talk later</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hey David I Woke up crying this morning lots of stuff boiling up in me at the moment.
I have a better understanding of the stresses and pressure Kristina is under as well as Anthony  and the kids,
When one member of a family unit is affected by health issues it rips it affect everyone and more so the people surrounding the person in trauma .
This made me think about my parents they have been really struggling during my separation in a way they have taken on the brunt of my greaving, I need to look after my home life and focus on repair,
The purpose of social dancing was to add a light fun layer to my life , I had communicated to you not to kiss me, I feel our relationship is getting to heavy and I'm feeling the weight on top of all the other weight in my life that I'm having to deal with, it saddens me that I may have to stop dancing with you because of the arousing and captivating effect that seduces  me into reciprocating your kisses.
In a perfect world I wish I could go out and social dance after a full on day of work and have a few dances to relax and have down time , it would be nice if it was with you it would of been cool if we could of practiced some show off dance moves for fun that we learnt at the Bachata Feastival. But I feel you want more from me and I can't give you more I want to keep things light in my social domain I cannot handle anymore, I want to be free to go out with new friends I have made I don't want to start resenting you because your not giving me that freedom.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hmmmm
Thank you for the honest message Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>I dont have the words to convey right now. I will take my time to meditate and reflect on this. I am glad you unburdened yourself of those feelings. I certainly do not what to be the reason for slowing your healing or growth or just being another chore in your life. For today I just want you to be happy and connected with your beautiful friend and her family. Have a blessed day Julia and stay connected to the sunlight of the spirit</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thanks David I also have incredible pain in my uppercut back I'm not sure if it's the soft mattress or that because of all the messages I'm giving Kriss I'm taking on the stress of her body, I really need to see Kana for some advice ,
I
David I need to be straight forward and  honest I don't have time for sugar coat sorry about that</div>
<div class='bubble david '>April 27</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you for the video David , and understand if your unable to pick me up tomorrow night, I can work something else out.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I will pick you up
don't worry about that
I would like to pick you up anyway, and it will be up to you if I just take you home, go for a chat or even go for a dance at Jam Gallery, we can leave that decision for Thursday night</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thanks for the chat</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Np</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>April 27</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I usually have one or two words to say to you before you go to bed but im running late tonight and i think you are likely asleep by now.
I just wanted to say good night and also to reply to your message this morning
Julia,  thank you for being forthright with me, I know you have been saying your truth for some time and I guess I get lost in my own selfish desires and emotions and forget just where you are at.
There is one big mistake that I have made and that is to kiss you on the dance floor.
I say this because the dance floor is a sacred place for people like you and I, it should be a place where dancers can let go, connect and sink into the rhythm of each other. In its purist we start to flow, become alive and for me it is the one place where I truly connect with my spiritual self.
In kissing you on the floor I start to rob that experience from both of us and I'm sorry for doing that.
I know for myself that I am not ready to meet someone.  As you know because I have been quite transparent (maybe a little too honest) about my own challenges and struggle. My own focus still needs to be on getting my own house in order.
Hearing that you woke up crying, I begin to understand the trauma you are going through and also how it affects the other people in your life such your parents and Sebastian.
I think you know that I care deeply for you and that isn't changing anytime soon I think, but i also know you need nothing more then a light and easy friendship.
If you were my dance companion and friend then i would be truly blessed.
I hope the new day finds you in happier spirits. Your friend Dave xo

<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>Look for my friend stella
Short  black hair
May 1</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, thank you for the lift last night,
From my meditation this morning, Stella and you have an amazing gift of service to our community, through dance you are presenting a way of healing for individuals that have been broken down in relationships helping them to make that step forward into a better space, your work is important to help people and I would love for you and Stella to be my mentor in dance as one day I would like to be at a level of dance to also do this for people as a volunteer community service by simply giving one beautiful dance to someone that has never experienced before, it is life change,
Stella and you and hopefully eventually me, we are changing lives with our volunteer community services. My sister does this in Auckland as well.
I was watching Stella and you patiently at work with the newbies on the dance floor and it was truly inspiring, a service volunteered service that should be added to your LinkedIn profile ha,ha
You were a gift to me from the universe when I danced with you for the first time at the Orient, it lit a spark in me and ignited my passion again for free life. I will always honour you for for helping me, David, that will never be erased fin my mind or messenger, ha ha
In reflection to last nights conversation and what you had spoken to the councillor about, I am sorry sending mixed messages, I was feeling week and vulnerable , I needed to be held as my mum and John are still sick i could not go to them, they also informed me of there financial issues having lost a lot of money in shares recently.
It is vital that I grow my business as I need to generate work for both Mum and I as soon as possible , my step dad has been trying to get work but with no success
I have nothing else but dance in common with you and so that is why I don't think our relationship should go into anything else as this would destroy what we have now and  the future of working as a team to give our God given services to help people ignite there passion and change there lives to create a better community a better world to live in one dance step at a time??????

<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia, I hope you are having beautiful day with Sebastian down at Shelly Beach, I was touched by the first half of your message and so grateful that you could see that aspect of me because I was little blind to it and especially last night. I often ask myself what more can I do in the service of my community and currently it is only around helping suffering alcoholics and once a month I do H&I (hospitals and institutions), currently I have been going to a low bottom psych unit to talk for an hour and have constantly been questioning what more I could do and had already contacted a prison representative to talk to inmates about alcoholism but I have not followed through and also thinking iff doing Soup Kitcgen service in Friday nights but hace not followed through but through your message you point out benefits of just taking a new person for a dance and giving over my ego and just having a connected dance with that person can be really healing and i can be of service in a way that is congruent with who I really am. Last night I was far from that place. I know that I was in a lot of self centered fear and when i was in the advanced class I was quite disconnected and irritated because I almost every girl was not at a level that I wanted. I don't know where you saw my service but last night. Your words "I was watching you and Stella patiently at work with the newbies" but I felt far from that place and I know that I do receive a lot of internal happiness when I am at service in that community
I  am very grateful for you saying what you did because I now have some clarity around what I can do to fill the contribution aspect of my life without worrying if i am doing enough or feeling like what i am doing is out of alignment with who i am
For the other part of your message I hear you
I am going to spend sone time today in natural environment and just think and ask questions from my higher power
But i was wondering if you would be ok catching up tonight to talk after you have put Sebastian to bed. I can come over to you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi David just give me a few minutes to read your message, Seb and I are having lunch then seeing jungle book then scooter and acro yoga I'll respond in a few ticks</div>
<div class='bubble david '></div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Why so urgent David can we talk on Wendsaday?

<div class='bubble david '>I want to be able to sit with just the idea of communication and in a nice environment such as the church at the end of your street
Yeah that could work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok

<div class='bubble david heart x'>I wanted to re-share our first poem<br />
</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia, I wrote this poem about  you, I hope it inspires your day</div>
<div class='bubble david heart'>The Dancer and the Artist<br />
Her body the brush;<br />
The floor, the canvas;<br />
The music, our heartbeat;<br />
Rhythm, Tempo, splashes of colour;<br />
Looking into her eyes, he embraces her<br />
The heartbeat is slow; they sway like leaves in morning air<br />
The brush moves, slow and measured, there is a build-up of earthy colours<br />
Soon the heartbeat increases, the brush glides across the canvas.<br />
He whips the brush in circular motion; blues, brightly spiral the canvas.<br />
The heartbeat erupts, he dips the brush, orange splashes outward.<br />
Colour lights up the canvas, as the brush moves to its own rhythm<br />
Soon the heartbeat begins to slow, back in embrace he cradles the brush<br />

Hey Julia,  just thinking of you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My heart is brimming with sorrow I need to do a practice now I collapsed into bed at 8pm exhausted from having to sit with my ex whist he ate dinner with Sebastian I wanted to scream at him and ask him why ? Of all the hurtful things I just woke up now to the sound of my son sobbing in his sleep I feel it's my fault I feel weak I'm going to do a practice with tears in my eyes and I hope I find some peace with my meditation, tonight's not a good night, my pain is bubbling up , fuck it hurts</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok
2 quick questions
How long for your practice?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Two hrs</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Would you be ok if i was therw for you to hug when your finished?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>1 half
No you have to work
It's ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>OK
I was just sending you lo5 minutes ago. I was praying for your success love and happiness
Ill leave you to your practice
Good night sweet Julia
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good night David thanks for listening</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Any time. If you need to talk tomorrow. Let me know</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>??
Feeling better now more in tune. I was feeling guilty that my son was crying. I thought it was my fault and felt his pain my pain, being with Peter tonight and with Sebastian was tough I had so much anger as it could of been a beautiful life  for us, sadness fills my heart. I was looking at Peter and thinking how handsome how smart how much I loved him. I know why he was cruel to me as he was going through his own grief of losing a father and loosing a friend to alcoholism. I was not strong enough to take on his aggravated soul he started using me sexually disrespectfully to fill his void and broken hearts, as I had already seen this behaviour with Paul warning bells rang and I had to escape as I met Paul at A time when he had just divorced from the love of his life, and we played devious games together, but I can't do that anymore not as s mother to a son I adore .
I need to be watchful of myself and listen to my spirit, if I need to cry I must cry , grieving is the touchstone to healing. Drumming, dancing, yoga, meditation helps me with that process, no sex I'm not ready as my sacred space still needs to heal.
Good night??????</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David have a fabulous day, I feel amazing I am going to the Kundalini centre in mosman to sign up for training, this form of yoga teaches how to draw energy in and how to control it so that it is not taken away, yesterday I felt all my energy being sucked from me with Peters presents a few aha moments happened and now I have some more clarity , see you a Kizoomba ????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Love being an observr of your journey Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David I love communicating with you, I trust you will honour my journey</div>

I received some internal gifts both last night and again earlier this morning through the reflection that these writings have been taking me</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>As I will care for you anytime you need a message a cuddle as I may need I will be there for you ginger tea dance date
Dates that you eat haha

When the heart brwaks ( opens). Journey deep inside</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hey! Give me a cuddle , everyone needs a cuddle I'm not a peace of stone</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I saw you do that last night after your meditation

�The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, not the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when you discover that someone else believes in you and is willing to trust you with a friendship.� ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
Elephant Spirituality</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson resonates with me, had not thought of friendship that way, thanks

<div class='bubble david '>Have a good day
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just stepped out  its a stunning day, I hope you have one to</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think I will, I spoke with my sponsor this morning (he is the wisest man I know and we had a chat about various things including dreaming and the idea that dreaming can be either toxic or tonic and we also talked about creative out expression for me (e.g drawing or something like that) and it got me thinking that the creative expression that I like doing that is good for my brain is poetry and so I now have an idea for a poem or maybe just a diatribe about dreaming.
Sorry that was just a brain dump, but I am feeling good today
tc xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Writing is one of my weakest forms of creative expression, I love your poetry?? another aspect of you that inspires me. Have to go play ground chit chat time????</div>

I just got confirmation that I can go to the meditation retreat in the blue mountains, I'm going to leave at 4pm on Friday, so stoked</div>

I was wondering if you would like to spend an evening with me, picnic style under the stars on the beach????
When you come back from retreat I would like to organise something special????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can think of nothing nicer then spending the evening, picnic style with you under the stars
I'm wondering if you are thinking of doing that on sunday night?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Your away</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>Let me get back to you with a time. So much has happened today I'm just feeling so amazing David. Exciting times now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I just did another Yoga Session, it was wonderful.
Trish started us of in a relaxing (she called it goddess pose) laying down for 10 minutes then did easy moves (cat, downards, others) then finished of with a 10 minute mediation.
Feel so good right now</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That is so good I'm looking at dates 22nd May Sebastian is with dad and it's a full moon, perfect for the spot I was thinking of</div>
<div class='bubble david '>22nd, sounds good</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ha ha funny
I'm trying to get the tone of that
How's your work going</div>
<div class='bubble david '>you can't do the 22nd
thats the black tie ball</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Shit Iv double booked</div>
<div class='bubble david '>good day at work, I'm building an android app today, so that's kind of exciting
I do hope we can have other dates between now and the 22nd anyway, or at the very least catchup for dance practice.
I'm wondering, do you want to make AcroYoga, a regular thing for a little while on mondays? (I understand if you need to at least wait until after Black Tie Ball), and also Tuesday Nights down at the retunda for dance  practice?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes I would love to meet befor , Tuesday's what is the earliest time as I would like to be home for Sebastians bed time</div>
<div class='bubble david '>when does he go to bed?
we dont need to do establishment (that can be optional) you can just be a mum on tuesdays and I'll come to you afterward if you like
we just then practice and leave dancing for wednesday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep sounds good</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'll fit around your life, in that regards</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Monday nights Broadway when rehearsals are over, Acro I'm thinking about. Not sure I think I like the free jamming seasons on the weekends</div>
<div class='bubble david '>ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to buy a mask
Thanks for reminding me</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm going to get back to work Julia, I feel great after the yoga, they asked me to mediate on something that makes me smile, and so I spent 10 minutes thinking of your beautiful face, your fierce spirit and your amazing energy, I'm so grateful for meeting you.

Julia?
Im in the next street just parking my car for tonight.  I know you are very busy in the morning</div>
</div>
<h2>06-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good Morning David, I don't agree, your not common nobody lives a common life we are all special and should be living our own lives following our own unique paths being touched by people that may cross our path, with meaningful communication and people need to be listened to.
David my whole body pulses with energy I as I am connected but it took two years of work in making the shifts,
I sent the Blog to Peter  from elephant journal thanking him for breaking my heart and how it had changed my life and giving me purpose to connect with people that respect me as I respect them listen to me as I listen to them and share each others wisdom of there journey with respect and honour, the children I teach, teach me a lot.
I am learning to listen with respect and this is something that I had not done in the  past and had ruined my relationship with Peter, listening and respecting with no jugment vital . Good morning David.
And patience David!!!!</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But if you want a 2 minute rendezvous. Just say and i will work by</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>A what ?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can give you a quick kiss on cheek
And cuddle if you want
Otherwise i will go to work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No I'm with my son getting him ready</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I figured that was the case
Have a great day Julia
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Wow yes as soon as my son is up its all go , done the school drop now I go to my favourite coffee place  before I go to work at home. Have a fabulous day, journal your experiences write poetry, everyone Has a different experience at retreat it won't be the same. ??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Have a good day
I'll just drop this on you as I wrote it earlier this morning, read it at your leisure
Hi Julia, I took some time to reflect on your message this morning, (well there are at least 3 messages in one).
I want to expand on my communication from my awakening, as you may have missed some of my intention around living an uncommon life, I agree that we have unique paths and that the crossing of paths adds meaning to everyone, for instance your ability to reflect on peter, to even thank him for breaking your heart is very powerful, my own leaps in growth have come from most painful experience and I welcome the growth today from my challenges, hopefully I won�t have too many truly toxic challenges but if I do, I know I never need to regret those experience nor wish to close the door on them.
I�m no rockstar, neither famous nor a guru, I�m no business superstar, but then I don�t equate these stereotypical views of success as meaning that these people are living uncommon lives.
When you say that everyone has unique paths, I would also add that everyone has own unique life changing gifts, but I�ve notice that most people don�t explore them, they don�t allow their gifts to blossom, everyone gets smashed in the face by life, and when this happens enough, most people give up on their dreams.
For me, living an uncommon life, is to continue to explore who I am, how I can contribute to planet, how I can be a positive influence to others, how I can take my talents and share them with the world and also find deeper meaning for myself in developing those gifts.
About 8 years ago, I wrote two different tag lines that have continued to resonate for me
- �Personal growth at just 2% per month, leads to doubling your personal capacity every 3 years�
- �The quality of my life is in direct proportion to my helpfulness�
I certainly have my ruts in life, depressions, slow times, but I know that I always come back to equilibrium and for me, that means to live life with Passion, to live life with Purpose.
Right now I am buzzing as I have just done another 40 �I am Statements�, I love that process.
>> �Good morning David. And patience David!!!!�
I am patient; I am patient with myself, my friends, with my son, with my higher powers plan for my life, and I am patient around you Julia.
I don�t need much to feel Joy, generally I manifest my happiness from within, but I will say that a simple dance under the stars with you; passionate kisses beneath a Moreton Bay Fig; or just holding you in my arms for five minutes on bench overlooking the harbour and I find a place of serenity that lasts for days.
I respect and honour the moments that I spend with you Julia.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David, I want to continue experiencing beautiful moments with you, With a bit more attention I have been giving my Mum dad and son in the last couple of days, I cannot begin to explain the change of dynamics in the house hold</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I take it that change in the household is positive?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I have looked after myself now I'm looking after my family circle then I will reach out and care for
My other circles so simple but makes Denver to. Work from the core out like everything else in the universe ????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It�s really good to hear that your family life is changing for the positive, I will steal beautiful moments with you when we can, but I will continue to respect your need to keep things light and breezy with no commitment.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Massive everyone is happy Mum's seems healthier John is excited with new projects to be working on so is Mum we are working together as a family community taking care of Sebastian  and representing how family unites can work well as a team to then help others, amazing ??
Thank you David ????????</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>May 6</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That writing bi osho is really powerful</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes, I think Kana got burnt recently that why she has shared, we have a lot of young men who need to read that message especially in the yoga love sharing community who in a way are abusing a spiritual trust and connection, or are just selfish abusers.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>do you think it is  male focused challeng?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Men and women are totally different in the way we think</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I agree, but I've been on the receiving end before</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah my friend Lucas also.
We share a common abuse in our fist relationships</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think it is very much a societal issue, and getting worse with apps like tinder
hey, I'm trying to push through some work over the next 2 hours, just wondering I have to pick up my car (decided to drive to leura tonight)</div>

Hi Julia,  not sure when you will get this message, not much reception which is probably a good thing.
I like this place, vegetarian dinner was wonderful. And the people i meet are in a different head space to the city. Numerous conversations tonight with people are throwin words around like, God, spiritual practice,  reincarnation as if it is the norm.
We had orientation tonight an will start with Ji Gong class at 730 in the morning.
I have just gone out for a walk up the road. It is so black ouside away from the cottage lights and really peaceful and the sky is lit up with stars. There is also the smell of ash and smoke because of undergrowth burnouts over the last two days.
I had a a goid trip up the mountains and I would frequently smile after thinking back to kissing you on the chair near your home, it was also nice to meet your mum. I was wondering if giving her flowers was the right thing, but the smile on her face was answer enough.
I hope the artists night of nights was goid for you both of you and would love hear about your night.
Have a wonderful weekend Julia xo
Good morning Julia xo
You make me laugh, i was thinking about yesterday just as we  walked away from your mum and you had this big bunch of flowers in hand and I suggested you leave them at your home and the (don't tell me what to do) Julia came out and with eye forward and fierce expression you said, "NO ... THERE MINE".
Just like a little girl who won't share an ice cream.
I love waking up to thoughts about Julia, have a good day xo</div>

<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,
I'm really happy that I can bring some happiness to you with really simple actions.
I dont have the resources right now to do grand gestures so i just do little things that come from my heart.
You motivate me, you inspire me.
I don't know where we are heading but I am enjoying the journey at the moment.
What I find most lovely is that this is all so easy, your easy to be around,  your easy to talk to, your easy to have fun with.
I am happy that I can play some small part in breaking down walls around your heart because that means you are healing and with that I see you opening up like flower in full bloom. You are so full of life and and energy and you seem to sparkle in the sunlight of the spirit.
I'm also grateful because you allow me to be me, and that means i can express my feelings with creativity and expression, and I'm finding that you allow this without judgment, you are helping me to become alive, its hard to put into words just how much I cherish the gifts you have been giving me just through be your natural self (I'm tearing up just thinking about it).
Have a wonderful day Julia xo
I will let you know later today but I may need to cancel seeing you today and tomorrow.  I can feel a burn in the the back of my throat and may need to rest up and make some sort of cold concoction to prevent  a cold from coming on.
Good day xo</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>??????????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I've been down the beach energising and reading different articles through links that started from the twin souls article you shared yesterday. I dont know if it is all the same auther but it is good reading</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Chat in an hour
Hi David, yeah it's an interesting read from my perspective to working out my body my mind and an idea as to why I may be drawn to a particular person at what level of intimacy should I share. This is a small part of what churns around in my head when I wake up at 3am, having to them go and yoga it out. I'll make the soup tomorrow with organic chicken  best recipe for nourishing the body whilst it's in repair mode, have s great day resting??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I look forward to your soup</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm going for a massage now.  Trying to give self love today
Talk later</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>Who do they think they are, to go around believing in themselves, loving themselves, admiring themselves, using their talents, expounding their ideas, opinions and wisdom, spreading their goddamn-blinding-Light?
Women who don't need approval from men to feel they are valid. Women who don't need to be kept by a man to feel they are safe. Women who don't need to be in a relationship just to feel worthy.
These are women who really, truly love men.
These are the women that hold the Real Keys to the spiritual progression of the Masculine.
They are the Ones who will love men from a place of re-discovered Wholeness and Empowered Essence.
This is what Men really want, and need, in order to be free, divinely-motivated, built-up, charged and ready for the New Era.
These Women of Spirit NEED men, and adore men. But they are programmed to CHALLENGE men at their very existential core.
This Is a Great writeup</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Teaching now I hope your feeling ok</div>

Good morning David, how are you feeling? Listen to your body, if it needs more time to recover allow it to. I sent you a lot of love. Love, I wonder why we live in a society that is so comfortable accepting of hate but feel suspicious and awkward with love. Loving my morning time by myself painting in the studio.
????
Just finished off with some ink</div>
</div>
<h2>11-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>Im a lot better.  But I know it could flare up, can feel that much. I will go to work and come home if i feel like im regressing.
My take on feeling suspicious of love is fear,  fear if being hurt, fear of going deep, fear of rejection. Taking past disappointments and  projecting onto present moments.
My other view if suspicion around love is self love or lack of it. I know that one if my biggest obsticles to living a full filling live is accepting and loving myself, I have an inner critic that is not my friend.
I've been doing lots of work around self love but have a long way to go.
I have found some renewed inspiration around exploring self love with reading various  transcodes articles about soul mates, twin souls, true love and seeing that to have some some really deep like that means really coming to love yourself.
I send love to you and your son and your parents on daily basis along with some other people dear to me but i sometimes forget to send live to myself.
I really love that you turn the flowers and poetry and what I  do for you into these works of art. It's like you take a moment in time, ir even a feeling in time, and physically make it permanent.
I appreciate that
Hope you understood all i wrote.  Lots of typos and grammer issues</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I found a morning practice of self care yoga meditation and grooming has made a big difference , you don't need to say I love me , Morison your body moisturise exercise meditate that's all the love I found I need to then love others</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think you have some some truth there. Taking care of self, nurturing self, self grooming and self respect</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Your body is your temple</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Well im preparing my day now, I will let you do the same. I really  enjoy bouncing of your wisdom

<div class='bubble david '>haha
May 13</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You stop sending me messages, poetry I see a change in our communication, not sure if I like this. Kind of reminds me of all the other beginnings and whenever things become intimate the romance and courtship stops, that's a shame David.
I'll need to reflect on this during my meditation I don't want the same shit happening as it has before, that is my greatest fear. I'm striving to carve new a new path and avoiding the same old, I'm tempted to take sanctuary with my sisters whist I heal, I feel it may be a wiser path
I'll reflect on this with my practice, ??
So angry David I could not finish my practice, spent most of my time in a head stand, this is where I felt most comfortable. I need to turn my life upside down for change.
I feel a lot of rage coming up its not safe for me and it's not safe for you, I'm still healing your still healing.
I have always reached out to men, I love men I love challenging men physically, I don't want to be labelled at the moment by you, feminist Horney I'm not ready to take on those labels without it hurting me a great deal.  I don't want to do this with you David, during my time of healing I will turn for help from my women friends women around me I seem to take for granted and I feel it is time to honour them, each time I was kicked in the guts or hurt I would always run to them during my most desperate time   It ahouldnt be like this I should have them around me all the time especially during my healing,
I'm not don't like David that you communicate to so many people about me  it makes me Cring each time I hear you have spoken to somonecelse about me , because of this I cannot enter a sexual relationship with you I need my privacy during my healing I need to find solace with my strong sisters who will guid me as you do with your female friends I need my sacred space to heal I'm not strong enough emotionally, to take on labels and judgment by A partner again, good bye David I need to journey this out alone ????</div>
</div>
<h2>13-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm sorry I created some pain
I was writing poetry again for you last night butcwas to sick to finish
I did not mean to imply or hurt</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just angry I want to ride my emotions and to feel free to do so without hurting anyone
I'm not stable I'm not at peace my therapist said Julia it's only been three months , you have done so well, what is the rush
I need to connect with a woman</div>
<div class='bubble david '>ok, I sorry
This is what I was writing last night, its not close to finished, I know where it is going, but it is about you, the tiger and the wolf
Who is this seductress, the fierce warrior princess?
The lovely temptress, who captures my interest.
Why! when I should be asleep,
Into my heart, you quietly creep.
Awake and in tune, my mind wanders this night,
My desire to see her soon, this graceful hawk in full flight
I power of the wolf, with sharp intelligence and an appetite for freedom,
I'm sorry I changed the way we were communicating, I guess I have and that is premeture
I was not meaning to be rude or disrespectful
I guess I was happy awakening another aspect of you, but I forget that your no where near ready for that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I know I look forward to a time when I'm more stable less reactive , it's been affecting my home life as well, I really need space and keep things light as I'm becoming clouded and irritated I'm only thinking about sex and nothing else it's driving me and everyone around me nuts</div>
<div class='bubble david '>if you also need me to be quiet with other people, I can do that, I guess I talk to people like tian, jin and ana because they are who I bounce my emotions with</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I then get angry and frustrated I need my space I don't wing to hurt anyone I. My healing process my family especially</div>
<div class='bubble david '>ok,
I won't respond, any more to this as I think you need to just do processing anyway, I'm sorry for my part
I will still write my poem about you today, I was ready yesterday about Shakespere and the idea of courting
I am very alive when I'm in the courting rituals with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to bounce my emotions off people to and reconnects with those friends</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can feel that I shifted my focus</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My girlfriends again</div>
<div class='bubble david '>but I will come back to what I really enjoyed about you and I, just the intellectual communication, the exploration of feeling with things like sex coming into the picture
without</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to heal</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm sending you my love Julia
Heal beautiful Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Sex is all I see when I see you
Sorry David</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Just Heal, your too valuable to be in this turmoil</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to connect with  my women friends I need to keep clear I need time , big things such as finalising my divorce are coming and j need to be in a place of clarity and focus and strength with no worries or uncertainties
I want to face Peter look him in the eyes unwavering and sign off our past life together
This is massive for me and I found that when it comes to relationships it's between two people, I want to hold that strength as I sensed it straight away with Peter when he entered another relationship with someone else when he lied to me for the first time
My house and home is a sacred space I must honour this, I am angry at myself that i was going to break the rules that I had created for my own sexual gratification,
Bye David</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can see your turmoil, I have definitely helped contribute to it, I know where I must be in all this, I have helped in pushing you forward in a direction your ready for
not ready for
Bye Little Wolf,  Heal Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Bye David
May 13</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi Julia, this was something I started last night, but was too tired to finish, I thought I would turn it into a picture frame for you, but I find my artistic skills are not really upto putting something together. but this poem is about you and I hope you like it
Who is this girl, the fierce little princess?
This lovely pearl, who captures my interest.
Why is it, when I should be asleep?
Into my heart, you quietly creep.
Awake to a tune, my mind wanders the night,
Will I see her soon, this graceful hawk in full flight?
In solitude she roams, for this warrior is on quest,
My heart knows she�s alone, yet I know it�s � for the best.
**
Protected by the wolf; she faces deepest fear.
A supernatural being, to guide the priestess seer.
For dark is the path, where temptation abounds.
She connects deep with self, to avoid dangerous hounds.
For the pack is her life; she gives her strength to their needs,
She must shield them from strife, and so silently grieves.
**
Guided by the tiger, royal lord of his domain,
Her vibration lifts higher; her strength she regains.
With sexual appetite coming into ascension, she looks out for a mate,
He says temper that sensation, it�s ok to wait.
But these feelings are powerful, unpredictable and wild,
He says nurture those feelings, but also love your inner child
**
It�s close to the dawn, the world starts to shine,
I whisper so softly; will you ever be mine?
Said a voice, in the gleams; she�s no prize for the taking.
Stay true to your dreams; said the sun on awaking.
Stay in the light, to your true self give love,

Are you o.k</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am sad
But not depressed</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Friday13th was crap</div>

And full moon</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Was that your 6 year a oversees
Anaversery</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>Thank god
Oh</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm sad.  But im grateful
You have brought a lot of meaning into my life in 3 short months
And you have lit a path for me</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Your incredible, i have never met anyone like you, your poetry is amazing I am so touched</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yesterday was particularly hard because i also got word that the ATO want me to bankrupt
I heard at 3pm</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Shit</div>
<div class='bubble david '>So i called  a sponsor.  Some new comers and tian
And i gave one of the best talks i have ever given for 30 minutes last night</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good</div>
<div class='bubble david '>On my experience,  strength and hope
I spoke about my tax
I spoke about my day in regards to you
I talked about my alcoholism
And i talked about my internal happiness and hope
I cried with jin at 1am last night
But i am still so blessed to know you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My Mim was wondering why you weren't around
Mum
I talked about what was happening,
To het
She sensed your intensity
I love it and thrive on it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But your not there</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>But it's not good for me now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You are like a bechamel sauce
You need a slow simmer
Or you go clumpy</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>When I paint this is what stimulates and inspires me
I need challenges at that time, but not now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just trying to function and get through the back log of paper
Workshops
Mother duties
Daughter sites</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You dont need to explain

<div class='bubble david '>I'm here for you if you need</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My mum is hear for me and you have gin

<div class='bubble david '>She is studying psychology</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>She is perfect for you now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Im taking her wisdom to the psychologist today at 1pm</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I work on intuitive impulse and regret when I think long term</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know you do
Just focus on your dealing with peter
You must be free of distraction
And i must plan my next dealing with ATO
I have meeting with my bankruptcy specialist on Monday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm not focused on him I'm focused on Sebastian first and then his father and how he is</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You are always focused on sebastian i know that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Peter will always be a victim</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But you still need to find internal solid ground around peter
He may not
I was a victim</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>He sucked me in I'm lucky to of gotten the fuck out</div>
<div class='bubble david '></div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes true</div>
<div class='bubble david '>People grow when the time is right</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
I have grown I need to be free
I m hungry for passion and sexual desires I need to be free to feed those urges</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I  personally have other faults equally as damaging as being a victim and going through yesterday and talking with Jin shone a spotlight on one of my own failings</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>And be a mum
And be descreat</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yep</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I don't know where you are at. But for me you are a dear friend

You are going through such a rough time David, it's like the universe is giving you a big slap about to get you on the right path, crapy, after my experiences of a good universal ass Kicking, if you keep doing the same shit. You will receive the same shit, all shifts David from the core out
Small shifts and adjustments

<div class='bubble david '>Haha. Goid thing about bankruptcy is it is only 3 years but i am still engaging the bankruptcy specialist to see if we can make a partial payment position of say 60 to 80K and stay out of liquidation as i have a number of opportunities coming into alignment right now

May 15</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>David it was so nice to laugh with you and have fun again. I missed it so much, we don't function well without dancing.
Your poem.
I feel the need to carve into glass, metal, clay or wood, you inspire me, you turn me on so deeply, with Your raw honesty.
I have never met some one like you, you captivate me you have an intensity that I find overwhelming and can feel lost in, scared, but addicted to the passion
You fill my mind for hours after we connect and I feel withdrawn and needing you close when you are gone for to long. Like tonight and every time I see you I get lost in the feel of your touch you give me goose bumps, you stir me from deep within. I will be gentle with you and mindful not to spew negative thoughts on messenger, I will journal write and chat to you about any issues face to face in the future and be mindful of your feelings, I'm sorry that I hurt you David especially with so much happening in your life. You trigger my heart with so many emotions. It gives me great joy to know that life will never be numb with you.
Six years of being sober. Congratulations David I look forward to laughing with you again on the dance floor
Xx ????</div>

May 15</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi Julia, I've just walked along bondi beach and it is great to feel the sun and see people living life with a smile.
I went to a meeting at Bondi Pavilion and I am struck by the laughter and merriment that people have in the face of tragedy.
One guy shared about his solution around constant fear having killed a guy with a hammer when he was in early recovery about 30 years ago.  He had a powerful message of hope.
But sometimes in the rooms you hear stories that go to another level and you never know if it is going to come out of the mouth of someone with 20 years or 20 day's.
But today a guy called "big wave Dave" shared about a meeting that was on father's day and also happened to be his 5th birthday and how his 15 year daughter humbly came up to him in the meeting and gave a father's card. He read the card during his share and it was a touching message from daughter to father.
He then spoke about the high, the elation because he had never received any father's day gift before.
He shared how later in the day he almost picked up a drink,  he wanted to celebrate. you see we drink to be numb, to be connected, to wash away loneliness, to feel good, to celebrate. We drink because it is a solution to all our feelings.
But he did not drink on that day but 42 days later he was on holidays with his daughter in Bali.
While they were there a bomb exploded and his daughter was in that crowd.
He wanted to drink but instead he reached out to the fellowship by phone and found some strength.
He came home without his daughter, she followed 15 days later but in 6 pieces.
Dave went to meetings and people held him and loved him and i got witness his grace and humility today on my sixth birthday in a meeting looking out on the ocean in a room full of tragedy, love and merriment.
I'm most grateful indeed today and wanted to share my morning with you.
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Wow some powerful stories, thank you for sharing your morning on your birthday,
You had asked me last night about Peter and I said I had no issues and don't think about him, this is the truth but not the whole truth .
I have been programmed from a young age to deal with horror or tragedy by putting into a box and dealing with it later, I express through my art my love making my dancing not so much through talking or writing, this is something g that I'm learning to do with you and loving this new form of expression,
I was always scared of writing as I was diagnosed with dyslexia in primary school   And felt like an outcast as I didn't understand the method they were teaching us at school,
I was fortunate to have help from an amazing phycologist who had a very alternate method of therapy that worked as my right side of the brain, the creative side is over active he tried balancing it out with meditation and particular exercises, I also suck at maths but I have an amazing ability of lateral thinking, intuition and the ability to observe and understand and do anything that needs to be made or designed, before I create sculpture for example I can see it like a cad image before I make it i also have an understanding of material and there limits.  This is the same with my drawing and paint, I can draw anything from memory .
I will be going to Bondi beach a little earlier for the meeting to have a Walk would you like to join me ?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes
I was going to do a meeting fro 5 to 6
Is 6 a good time to meet
Or is that too late</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I was just checking the time I ll be cooking dinner hear for 5.30 then head over 6.15-630pm
The event is 7.45</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Is it at bondi</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
Near the beach I think
Yoga studio</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Let's connect after 6 and arrange meet-up</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm signing up tonight this is the class times I'll commit to and the Friday is alternating ,
social I'll do up on broadway Monday nights after class as a regular telly loved that place my favourite and play it by ear the rest of the week I'll be working a lot more so won't commit to to much more than that
Hi David??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi julia
Just cleaning window frames then rushing to meeting
Will chat later</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep after 6</div>
<div class='bubble david '></div>

<div class='bubble julia '>May 15</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Julia, i had a great night tonight. I'm glad we were able to connect for an hour beforehand. I really like you and me time. Just walking,  talking and kissing.
A request. When you leave me to go home, do you think you can send me just a quick message to say that your home. I mean before you do shower and stuff.  I just want to know that you are home safe</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi David I had an amazing Night, I'm thrilled that you came, this group inspires  and energises me, give me strength and focus, I love observing the rituals and systems of honour and gratitude on the multi levels of our existence on earth,.
It was special to me to have you there and your share touched me.
I was also emotionally touched with my sister. A room of such beautiful and loving gentle wise people,
I'm safe and Sebastians still breathing clearly ??????</div>
</div>
<h2>16-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks for letting me know you are home</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good night sweet dreams my masculinity half my poetic dance partner xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Was not going to bed until i knew
Good night sweetheart xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>So sweet, I'm so relaxed and tired and feel content and serene loved the drumming , good night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>May 16</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, how are you?
I love your om my Om needs work did 12 this morning after practice and defiantly needs more practice.
Have a great day ??????
Hi</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi julia
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ox</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Just leaving home right now. Slow going this morning</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I got up late 6am but had a good sleep and practice, Sebastian has fever so at home with me today,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Looks like you may need to spend a few days just around the home this week
Is it croup or cold</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Both</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I hope recovers quickly</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Mums going to the next circle this Sunday with Carman drummer very excited</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Dies she go to other circles
Does</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'll be dancing so sadly will miss it
No not I'm trying to get her into it , I would like to host one with her in the future
From our place</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That sounds like a great idea. I can see how nourishing the circles can be</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Things are all happening David intuitively nothing pushed in due course</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think part of what made last night so great was the energy coming from the partacipants
It was so soft and gentle but with a purpose</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I was imagining a world that had millions of such groups</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
Strong respectful and gentle</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I was also liking the idea around promoting and giving rise to the feminine energy especially as a counterpart to masculine energy
Personally I have a big problem with feminism
I have seen the destructiveness and decisiveness if feminism</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>So do I if its disrespectful</div>
<div class='bubble david '>And how it can lead to men becoming feminine and wonen becoming masculine</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You don't like lesbians?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But i love this more yiguc form of feminine power
Yogic
The idea that it is a union
No problem with lesbians
I guess when we get a chance to sit and talk
I would like to share my perspective around feminism in its dark form</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes David I love a the masculine that can lead with respect to the feminine , watching my sister and Adrian and how they work together was beautiful and very inspiring, I want a connection like that.
But I also am a worker
Izabella doesn't work
On her own business</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But in response about lesbians and women living in the masculine.  I have no problem with that if the woman is inherently masculine in nature  aka butch. What i really dislike is a feminine soul who pursues masculine power due to societal condition</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>She works for Adrian</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Is that good or bad for her</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>So my relationship would be something different and something I need to work out the balance with,
She has never been able to finish anything by herself , she dropped out of two university courses and jumps in differ t directions she talks a lot connects slot but does not do a lot, unless directed by her love
A lot
She needs a guru to follow
That's how she's been brought up by her mum</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Something to note though is that she connects  a lot abd one of the most valuable skills on earth is the connectir personality</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My mum brought me up to hold my own power
I know</div>
<div class='bubble david '>She has a special foundation skill that is a good starting point</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's her gift
We all have our own gifts</div>
<div class='bubble david '>As to the other issues.  She can learn then and nuture them if she comes to understand that it is important</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I would love to have a partner that will balance me</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I have some connector skill.  But it is totally a learned skill.  It only got to where it is because of training
I was your typical anti social intravert geek</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I know I love that as this is my weakness and you are teaching me this to</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm still an intrevert. I find my energetic strength is solitude
But i can move outside that circle when i need
I don't see a weekness in you as a connector
I see it very strong
But maybe you need to use it with both focus abd purpose</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Maybe more physical than verbal</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But always holding onto the notion of from a place of service</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Making dancing yoga
Teaching
Working with children
Teaching children and connecting with children is my gift</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes that seems your most natural talent
I guess if that can merged with developing some sort of marketing
Especially stage or group pr</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think you have a real capability to become expert in niche
To present your ideas from a platform
Stage. Video. .. or some sort</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I spoke to a brother last night about the meditation retreat</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You could create a really big busy if you got some of that under control
Business</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Let's talk together about that some time</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I know I'm working towards that David
E learning
Production is all part of my 5 year plan., I do have a goal</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Integrate presentation into your business vision</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>This has been in thecpipline before divirce</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Presentation is the most powerful if all the business marketing  tools</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Now I can pick up from where I left it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes let's talk dance and Om together ha ha
Gotta go</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Bye</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Have a great day</div>
<div class='bubble david '>xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Xo
I'll share some of my vision diary
With you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks
Go to work.  Talk later beautiful princess</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Business plan whatever's you want to call it o have done both
Just without the need to present it to the bank
I'm in the process of gathering connecting and learning befor production befor promotion
For e learning and retreats
st Lucy's job is an important part of the path
Sati lite classes arepartbof it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I was thinking that while you and I have limited time to connect and that when we do it is either in fun activity or kissing.
I would like to see our connection develop in other other areas. E.g. business accountability partners. I know I can help you there and support/push if needed and I know you can definitely help me there as well.
But not involved in your business. I'm not looking to entwine.
I just think that you and I spending some of our time together working on business  (vs in business) may be quite empowering for us individually and maybe for some future path if our relationship develops.
You want many things in a partner,  i know.  But one of them is someone who will challenge you to grow and that is what I want and you certainly do that for me.
I  would like to see that develop into something that is more union like rather than the current form which is kind off inspiring but individual.
Ie you inspire me to be more.  But I know that i could be a hundred times more with the right person.
Just want to explore some of those ideas with you
Please note: small steps at first</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok David, I need to go and let us talk about this more, I am Intreasted to listen to you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Such as sharing vision
Ok
Have a good day
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You to????

<h2>17-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,
I just wrote this poem on the 380 bus.
I hope your sleep was restful and your dreams were light.
I wished a guardian angel to look over you last night.
As I ride in this bus, I see the sunrise on fire.
I'm thinking of you princess,  the beautiful woman I admire.
As I travel through the five ways, I feel blessed in these happy days.
And as I arrive at the quay, to take the early morning scene
My heart is open to your key, for to me, your a queen</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My body is in pain , I pushed it to hard last night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Im standing in front of that picture right now
Im going to do some oms on the water before I go to work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You make me smile
Thank you for the poem, i need some time to wake up</div>
<div class='bubble david '>As do you Julia.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Slept deep for the first time in ages.
I need a shower I feel I I want to go back to bed</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Must have been watched by an angel</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Have a Wonderful morning David chat later</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Have a good morning Julia
Later
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ox
I was a bit reckless last night with my body, I do that on occasions, due to exhaustion or stress of the day I physically vent and this morning I was in pain,could not move.
Until your poem pinged in this morning and snapped me out of feeling sorry for my wrecked body and initiate my self care process.
Still in a bit of pain my son is also home sick again and I have two classes to run and juggle someone to care for him whilst I teach as mums working , I'm going to lay low and self care when I can for the next few days  David my body is screaming for it.
Have a wonderful day  ????????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good, look after yourself Julia
I spent some time down at the harbour doing Oms
it was good for me
and having that 20 minutes on the bus with nothing to do but write some poetry was also really good for me, it was my form of self care for the day and mentally and spiritually I have felt very light and refreshed all morning
Have a good day
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Xo

Good morning Julia
How was your meditation this morning</div>
</div>
<h2>18-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>I was just thinking of you
This Friday
I would like to expose my scares to you, I'm scared but I think it needs to be done as part of my healing, I feel Peter has control of me and I want to break that tie</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok
Would you like to do dinner before or after yoga</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Why we talking about food times, ha ha
Yeah before something light
Funny</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Just thinking of a place where we can talk without distraction</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Oh ok
Hmm
Newtown
Friday night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I get the impression you want to open up</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Packed</div>
<div class='bubble david '>And I want to hear who you are at the deepst level
It will be cold outside</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No David I want to have sex with you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hmm</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hmm</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Are you ready</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
I am scared, but willing to face my fears.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>OK</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok
Don't talk about it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I won't</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I want to be subtle
Private to us only
But I will be committed to you
If anyone makes advances to me I will let them jknow only at that time that I'm with you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Can i ask how you feel about me Julia,  i can see it in your face but your words are often guarded</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I love you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>How to make a guy cry on the train
Thank you Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Oh no sorry</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I love you too</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I dint care about expressing feelings
Im happy
I know this is just early love but i hope we can grow this into something truly special</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Me to and I feel that you will be gentle with my feelings as you already have? Learned or unlearned I don't care what my mum says she is alway warning me of the worst and to see if I can handle it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I was taken aback about your mums warning
I guess on reflection</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's why I'm guarded I always look at what the worst could happen</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That the david off age 24 was deeply disconnected from the world</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Then I reflect and see if I can deal with it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>And his feelings</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm reDy
I feel lighter
Now
It must be a good thing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You are listening to your inner voice i think
Thats what I lije about your meditation
You can tap into your gut instinct</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I have to go and get ready. Mixed message I'm no allowing my mind to rule over my heart</div>
<div class='bubble david '>And i have been finding more wisdom in my gut then in my 5 five clisest wisest friends</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep let's follow it. The meditation will be a great start to apowerful night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Have a good morning sweetheart xo you make so happy xoxoxo</div>

<div class='bubble david '>Was that the boys today</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
Not many girls at the school</div>

Then aim for those sort of classes from your studio</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes good thinking</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You can have any client you want. Aim for someone you love working with
You should put some effort into the perfect avatar</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Its the type of client that you want to work with
Then your marketing is based around that concept</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Rather then spray and pray marketing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep good advise</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You can focus on your ideal client  and it sounds like you know who they are</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I Kinda do that with my buisness now
Kids
Then the adult stuff is an extra
Kids have parents</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Maybe we talk that over some time.</div>

<div class='bubble david '>You know a nice fit would be to do parent and kids classes together
As a bonding exercise</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to refresh all my she biz stuff

<div class='bubble david '>Teach parents and kids different ideas but with some sort of connecting goal</div>

xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Xo
Hey I thought that poem was for me David
Hmmm
Bad choice
Nothing's sacred obviously</div>
<div class='bubble david '>What the dance poem
It is. I was talking to my sister Ana about you
And the poem i had written for you
I was just talking to her about the magic you bring into my life.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Your poem seems a bit diluted David and thin when your words are spread around so much.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>?
Are you angry that I would  talk about you to Ana?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You talk to much to everyone
I don't like it
You post the poem that I thought you wrote for me on Facebook with comments of people getting boners over it, for fuck sake you know nothing of value or holding something in a sacred space.
Mum was right
As alway</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I did post that poem on Facebook a few weeks ago. I am definitely daft to some things and im sorry that hurt you.
The guy who wrote that comment is always inappropriate.
As to to Ana, I called her for her birthday which was yesterday and I spoke about you, thats the sought of relationship I have with her. I'm know your angry with me, I  was not aware of any mistakes I had made.
Im sorry</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Well you defiantly now how to open those boxes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You mean boxes that hurt you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I have to get. Back to work</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Dear Julia,
I really did not understand the harm I was causing you when I posted that poem, i remember on the day thinking that all I wanted to do was write that this poem is for Julia but I could not disclose that.
I know that when I wrote the second poem, I would not share it with anyone because it is deeply personal to me.
Your's are the only eyes that have seen it, your's are the only ears that have heard it.
You see all I want to do is learn the song that is in your heart and if one day you forget it, I want to be there to sing it to you and remind you.
I have spoken a little to Ana about you and more to Tian. I can't imagine not talking to them about you as you bring magic and light to my soul.
I will not likely to sleep fir a while.  I know what I'm like, I will most likely fret about this all night.
There is one thing I believe to be true, never go to sleep angry at the other person.
I'll be here and if you need to talk or vent or tell me off then do so.
Once again I am honestly sorry to have hurt you.
David xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Get some rest David I have so much work to do
May 19</div>
<div class='bubble david '>xo</div>
</div>
<h2>19-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>It is time for me to greave David</div>
<div class='bubble david '>ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you for understanding that yesterday
Letting me understand that yesterday
During my Om practice tears welled in my eyes
I can't expose myself to you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Just be gentle on yourself Julia, I'm here if you need, but I will be distant if you need space
I will just send my love your way</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need some one that can gently pull at the string to open my boxes of sorrow and gently unwrap each broken package so that I can take my time to put the peaces back together</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I not sure if you're aware of it, but every time we have spoken or alluded to anything sexual, you have quickly become unhinged. I guess that is why I asked you if you are ready the other day. I don't think you are close to ready.
This is the one area where I keep breaking my own promise around you and it is the one area where I fuck up with you.
I'm sorry about that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Last night felt like a box knife had been used on the package that had contained my heart ?? I thought you were of service to me in helping to repair and put the peaces together , but you are not
I was alone last night and that is where I find my deepest strength
I am alone when I face my demons
I am alone when I face my fears
I get strength from my yoga
Meditation
Self care
I will now focus on my business as my creative outlet</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I can resonate with what your saying, I have had to face my biggest demons on my own as well. It nearly killed me going through that, but it had to be on my own</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My heart is to open for social dancing I feel to exposed
I don't want to become one of your poster girls on Facebook
Incognito
This weekend will be the last time I step on stage and perform
Through dance
I will now only perform with my art and yoga practice
There is a dirty side to dance that I'm not strong enough to handle, yet!!
I need to be surrounded by a gentler more holistic form of physical expression, during my time of grieving , I hope you understand this David ??
Reading back. You do, ??</div>
<div class='bubble david '>?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>David I don't want to use you as a punching bag when I have emotional flair ups I don't want you to come any closer to me at this time it will only hurt you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah
I'll just keep my distance,
Maybe in a some future time, we can look at things together
I'm just going to go back to working on my self
I love you deeply</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That is a good idea , we stepped over the boundrys of kissing coming closer I will hurt you
I love you to David, my son I know loves me
He kicks me all the time to vent his sorrow
The phycologist explained this is a normal process the people you love will hurt you the most , you know that yourself David</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Do you want me to hurt you?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>No</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Some people like it
Good</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I assume you are talking about the dominatrix mentality</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah that guy rattled me a bit</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That's not something that I am looking for
I respect you for that period of your life
I respect it because it shapes who you are
but
but its not what I want for me</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good neither am I nothing good comes from it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>The people I have had the most problems around in the last few years (Ana, My Son Steven, My Flatmate Sonia "you don't know her") have all nearly brought me undone, they have been people who I deeply love and care for, but I have almost destroyed my self on them
I don't want to destroy myself with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Gotta go</div>
<div class='bubble david '>bye</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David , my head is clouded at the moment
It was hard to keep focus and put on a happy face whilst I was teaching
Got a play date this afternoon , I need to go on retreat again I need space</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know
I'm hoping to go on a retreat on the 6th June (if a position becomes avail)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>The same as befor
The cult</div>
<div class='bubble david '>this is an AA retreat
the other cult
;)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>this is more my tribe</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to go now or in the next week
I like the idea of having our seperate things it becomes stifling
I could ask Izabella if she wants to take your ticket for Friday night
Let me know, have good day bye
I don't want to destroy you David I never want to hurt you I am not disrespectful or abusive I keep respectfully to people's boundaries. Unless they request in a controlled and caring manner.
I understand what it is like to be hurt boundary's have been broken at the beginning of our relationship could this have been the case with all of those other horrible people that have hurt you in the past? Did you overstep some boundary's with your previous relationships?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>the answer to that is long and varied I guess</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>So complex you are</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I think part of the problem for you and I is that I met you 6 months to early</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Haha yes
I'm still in the chickens bum
The egg thing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>The big difference I find between you and past relationships, is that
A. I am in a much better place with self (lots of self love and acceptance in me today)
B. I would not put up today (with what I found acceptable in the past)
C. You are (as you say, in the chickens bum)
I know that you are right for me
but you personally are not right for anyone right now
you need to work on you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's right I repeat I would like to keep it light , I think I have said this a few times</div>
<div class='bubble david '>yep
I think part of our problem is that we have such feelings for each other that keeping it light is nearly impossible
that's why I know I should have met you in 6 months</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>But we can't keep it light because there is something deeper connecting us</div>
<div class='bubble david '>yep</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's the fucked up thing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I don't know what it is, I think it might be something like twin souls or soul mate
but as I have already read when looking into this
if personally you are not ready for your soul mate, then your should not even try to be with them</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes and I don't want to be thinking I have to be controlled by that connection</div>
<div class='bubble david '>yeah</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Until I have done my healing journey
Solo
Women's circle's and yogic circles, will be my medicine, focusing on my business and being free to do it however I wish is my goal this year,  I think I said this all before,
Good buy David??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>(y)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>And in regards to not being ready to connect with anyone else, forget that I'm all about connecting with people who energise and respect me and understand boundaries
Friendships is all I have and I value those the most at the moment in my life
My circles are blooming and I'm loving and growing from being apart of each person I learn from</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm very happy for that part of your life
keep growing and blooming</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>This is the best time I have had in 14 years David I want to be free????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>(y)</div>

But i love this communication</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Nothing numbing

<div class='bubble david '>Winter wolves singing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>May 20</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,
I woke around 430 this morning but really needed to rest and have been just lying here day dreaming.
It's been relaxing to think about you.  Imagining you in your different yoga poses,  eyes closed,  serenity on your face as you sink into your meditation.
I've been sending love to you, and surrounding you with with light, warm yellow glowing balls of gentle heat to melt away your fears.
This morning I have also massaged you from head to toe and breathed life into your tight muscles.
I've washed the souls of your feet, massaged them in such a way that spiritual energy flows through to every organ of your body, radiating health and vitality.
I have also put my lips to your feet and with every flick of my tongue or kiss of my lips I have sent kindness and compassion to the darkest areas of your body so that the physical walls that are blocking you will crumble and you can be free.
Your soul and mine have been intermingled and I've watched as they danced along the edges, undulating and entwining. Sometimes as one soul,  some times as lovers the lightest of touch only in the most sensitive of places.
When I touch your soul in this way I know true connection,  my body tingles,  my heart opens and I feel fully connected to god.
Thank you Julia,  I am grateful this morning.
xo
Good morning Julia,
I feel  a tad deflated right in this moment as i have spent a couple of hours in poetic meditation and was writing prose with words that were flowing through me but not from my limited intellect.
I was given such a gift this morning as I wrote to you and then as I hit send I somehow deleted it all.
Maybe this gift was only meant to be for me today.
I hope you have a lovely day. I think I will because I still have the memory of what I wrote in my heart.
Goid day xo</div>
</div>

Yoga and spirituality has been the key for my healing proses we connect spiritually on the dance floor and I would love to continue to explore a spiritual connection with or love making, my body is a juicy flow again and I haven't had that for two years , I dried up with Peter it was horrible.  I'm flowing with you it's beautiful. I feel calm and relaxed I slept deep and feel rested, centred, thank you for sharing that with me and letting me express the moment with you. David. I love, also remember to live in the now and not the past  I realise I'm able to do that now, I am trying create a practice that will help me surrender to the future and trust In God that I Dont need to worry so much, everything will be o.k. Good morning David . I love you????????</div>

<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi Julia had a great meeting this morning,  the topic was on resentment, which is always a great topic for me to reflect on as it is the spiritual malady that has most ruled my thinking over my life.
I  enjoy the opportunity to look at this aspect of self and my own delusions
The rest of today i will be helping  tian  move from McMahans point to Kirribilli.
I realized that we did not end talking about feminism, maybe next time.
I hope class was good this morning.

Good night my exhausted beautiful tiny dancer
xo
I awoke in the mist, but where? I not say.
The air glistened and sparkled, alive this new day.
Beauty danced right above me,  movement fluid and gay
Her body flowed in the flight, like a stunning blue jay
The flesh naked and lush, a beautiful Monet
I long for her touch, sultry temptress, so risqu�
To my loins would she touch? dear God I do pray
Heaving breasts let me cup, in my arms if you may
But as the mist starts to clear, my heart breaks in dismay
She fades from my sight, I cry out, oh please let her stay

Good night Julia xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good night David xo
May 23
I woke up with the first thought in my mind  being you.
After meditation and Om, i prayed to God and expressed my gratitude for the universe bringing us together.
I love you David, have an amazing day. ????????xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks you Julia. You are always my first thought too.
Im so tired this morning. I could not fall asleep till 2pm

Have a good day xo</div>

I will write more poems over time, I'm sure.

<div class='bubble julia '>Yes this is something I am working on at the moment in my reflection time as for context of display, undecided I will need to reflect on what way will be suitable that will keep integrity and honour of our interaction that I hold close to my heart.

<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,
My day yesterday was emotionally flat and I found it hard to live in the moment. I think mostly I was disconnected from gratitude.
Today I am grateful.
I am grateful to be sober.
I am grateful to have professional guidance for my financial challenges.
I am grateful to have a connection with my son.
I am grateful that my mum and dad are in my life.
I am grateful for good friends.
I am grateful for interesting and challenging work
I am grateful for the passion that has been ignited through poetry and verse
I am grateful for light and energy that I see all around me when I look outwards
I am grateful for the strong roots I have created over last few years leading to my emotional stability.
I am grateful to see beauty in this world through the photographic eye
I am grateful for the synchronicites that led to a deep connection with Julia
I am grateful to see my world massively expand through this powerful woman
I am grateful for the heightened connection to God that I feel whenever I think of Julia
Julia, to me you are like a prism that obsorbs all the beautiful energy flowing in and splits that energy into a million colours that illuminate every facet of my life.
Thank you
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Wow David, thank you. Passion is what inspires me, to live a life each day without passion and intensity of my god given purpose on this world.
Huge events are unfolding for me today, nothing that I expected, won't be able to talk about it , following intuition is  key to a sacred life David??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>No worries Julia, be where you must be
Take care xo

The dragonfly, in almost every part of the world symbolizes change and change in the perspective of self realization; and the kind of change that has its source in mental and emotional maturity and the understanding of the deeper meaning of life.

<div class='bubble david '>"The dragonfly  symbolizes change in relation to mental and emotional maturity and the understanding of the deeper meaning of life." - it all seems providential to me as I did not know about the meaning and yet the message feels congruent with where I  am at this year.

<div class='bubble julia '>"We are approaching a period of time when relationships are ready to go through a major redesign. The current paradigm isn't working. People are unsatisfied in love; people don't know how to make relationships work. And, believe it or not, this isn't a bad thing. Because when systems break-down, that's when they change. I believe that's what's happening in the area of intimate partnership. The break-down is forcing us to move towards conscious love. So what exactly is a conscious relationship? It's a romantic relationship in which both partners feel committed to a sense of purpose, and that purpose is growth. Individual growth. Collective growth as a couple. Growth that makes the world a better place. As of now, most people get into relationships to satisfy their own personal needs. This might work for a few years, but eventually the relationship fails us, and we end up unsatisfied as a result. But when two people come together with the intention of growth, the relationship strives towards something much greater than gratification. The partnership becomes a journey of evolution, and the two individuals have an opportunity to expand more than they could alone. Deep satisfaction and long-term fulfillment arise as a result. So if you're someone who feels called to take your experience of romantic love to the next level, below are four qualities that characterize what being a conscious couple is all about. Welcome to the path of the conscious relationship. This is next-level love ... 1. The conscious couple is not attached to the outcome of the relationship - growth comes first. Not being attached to the outcome of the relationship does not mean you don't care what happens! It also doesn't mean that you don't have fantasies about how the relationship will turn out. What it means is: you're more committed to the experience of growth than you are to making the relationship work. The reality is, we're here to grow. Physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. When growth stops, we automatically feel like something's gone wrong. Because it has. Without growth, we aren't fulfilling our soul'spurpose. Unfortunately, relationships today tend to stifle growth more than enhance it. This is one of the main reasons we're failing at romantic love. We want our partners to act in a certain way, we repress ourselves to please others, and soon enough, we feel small, oppressed and puzzled about who we've become. This, inevitably, makes the relationship feel like a cage that we want to break out of. But the unfortunate truth is: we've caged ourselves. The conscious couple values growth more than anything else because they know this is the secret to keeping the relationship alive. Even though growth is scary (because it takes us into the unknown), the couple is willing to strive towards expansion, even at the risk of out-growing the relationship. Because of this, the relationship maintains a natural feeling of aliveness, and love between the couple does, too. 2. Each person in the relationship is committed to owning their s**t. Conscious couples know that we all have wounds from the past, and they understand that these wounds will inevitably be triggered, especially in a relationship. In other words, they expect to feel abandoned, trapped, rejected, overlooked and any other shitty feeling that arises when we bond closely with another person. Most of us still believe that relationships should only feel good, and when bad feelings surface, something has gone terribly wrong. What we fail to see in this situation is that these shitty feelings stem from our own faulty patterning! These issues are not caused by our partners; they're caused by our beliefs. The conscious couple is willing to look at their past and current issues in relationships because they know that by facing these beliefs systems, they can evolve into a new relationship-reality. Dysfunctional patterns will dissolve, but only when we take responsibility for them, first. 3. All feelings are welcome and no internal process is condemned. In a conscious relationship, there's room to feel anything. Not only that, there's room to express those feelings and fantasies to your partner. This is edgy territory; it's not easy to do. But it's also one of the most healing things we can experience in a partnership. It's rare to be completely honest about who you are, and to stretch yourself to let your partner do the same. You may not like what you hear; in fact, it may trigger the hell out of you. But you're willing to be triggered if it means your partner can be authentic. Like I already said, we're used to moulding and changing ourselves to please people we love because we don't want them to stop loving us! This stifles the love out of our connections. The only option is radical honesty: revealing parts of ourselves that are hard to share, and letting our partners do the same. This leads to feelings known, seen and truly understood; a combination that will automatically enhance your love. 4. The relationship is a place to practice love. Love, ultimately, is a practice. A practice of acceptance, being present, forgiveness, and stretching your heart into vulnerable territories. Sometimes we treat love like it's a destination. We want that peak feeling all the time, and when it's not there, we're not satisfied with what the relationship has become. In my mind, this is missing the whole point of love. Love is a journey and an exploration. It's showing up for all varied nuances of your relationship and asking yourself, what would love do here? The answer will be different every time, and because of this, you'll get to grow in ways you never have before! The conscious couple is fiercely committed to being the embodiment of love. And through their devotion and practice, love shows up in their lives and relationship in ways they would've never imagined before." ~Shelly Bullard

<div class='bubble david '>Wow, there is so much in that article
I like 2 of the initial paragraphs, 1 being "But when two people come together with the intention of growth, the relationship strives towards something much greater than gratification. The partnership becomes a journey of evolution, and the two individuals have an opportunity to expand more than they could alone. Deep satisfaction and long-term fulfillment arise as a result."
I printed this out
Love to chat about it with you from the comfort of the couch some tiime</div>

<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, wow you must be tired, have a great trip David I sent lots of love to you and Steve,
My body's feeling a little off balance I ate to much of my yummy pork belly last night and it has affected my yoga practice and also didn't get any visions, I'll need to be mindful of minimising my meat especially at night.
I have a big day Photoshopping and posting on website then I need to go west to my clay supplier and then meeting with Peter for our last council. Before we sign off next month, I may go to tropical sol for my own therapy.
Getting all my financials done next week and the the following weekend I'm heading out of town, I need a break as I need a refill.
Safe travel, love you loads and will send love to you both.
??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Your little body is not really designed for pork belly ??
I hope you and Peter have a beneficial coucelling session.
Enjoy your dance therepy tonight if you make it
I plan to call my sponsor when I land and discuss making step 9 amends with Steven
Step 9 : "Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others"
I'm looking forward to seeing Steven, I think it should be a really goid weekend for us
Thank you for your prompting message yesterday
Love you sweetheart and wish you a beautiful day xo
Taking off now</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Let me know your flight back I will try and pick you up</div>
<div class='bubble david '>May 27
Hi Julia,
It�s been a pretty good day today, mum got out of hospital this afternoon, they have given her fluids and antibiotics, but said she can head home.
Steven was very happy to see me, which was nice, he mentioned this a few times today. We had a good day. Walked around a lot and spoke, had lunch went to the Pub, played pool in 8 ball hall, His Nana (on mums side) who he did see last week, but had not actually seen in 3 years also drove down today to give him is phone charger that he had left behind, so Steven, his nana and her partner and I had dinner together tonight. He has gone home now, he has to get up early to work all day tomorrow, I will catch up again on Sunday morning and then he heads off to go to work on Sunday evening.
I�ve just booked a flight back and will arrive in Sydney at 4:30 pm on Sunday.
I�m going to go to an AA meeting and then a Salsa Dance tonight.
I�m very grateful for this weekend.

<h2>28-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>David I would like to thank you for helping understand my strengths. It has helped me heal.
I can look in the mirror each morning and see myself as a strong woman .
Peter was so toxic to me and had filled me with self doubt, as I am my worst critic  I know what j do wrong I just need love from you David and you say you don't need anything from me, well I'm willing to love you David for who you are I'm willing to share intimate moments with you,
you make my body tingle my my tummy stir.
I understand now because of our living circumstances Tantric love making and spiritual connection is what we are meant to explore with each others spirituality in dance and love making, I'm excited to do this with you David , I now understand what we are together , we will heal each other. And honour each other and become better people together .
I value you David I honour you David, I love you David.
Have a wonderful day ??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>How it is, that you can move me to tears.
I have been looking for someone like you all my life, I have always been a hopeless romantic and always thought that there was someone out there for me
But really I had also lost some  hope that I would ever meet this person
You seem to fit me like glove
I think now that I was never meant to meet someone like you until I was ready to start healing my self,  to take responsibility for my life
I really made some bad choices 6-7 years ago that have really contributed to Stevens current lifestyle
I was able to look at them a little with him yesterday and it gave me clarity around what I am really making amends for with Steven
You see. Making a Step 9 amends has nothing to do with saying sorry. The word Amend is rooted in the idea of mending
I either have to mend the damage i did to Steven or I have to mend my ways so I don't act the same way in future
You have been significant in my healing and I honour you for that Julia
But I have taken responsibility for my own healing first and I honor my self and accept my own self love there
I know we will become better people  (for ourselves) because of our connection as friends, as a couple and as lovers
I call you sweetheart, because it is the best word I know that conveys the purity that I see in your emense love,  weather that be for me, your son snd family or for yourself
Have a wonderful day sweetheart,   share your gift with your students this morning
Keep being the powerful, compassionate, fierce and loving lady that I see whenever I think of you
xo

Hi</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi</div>
<div class='bubble david '>how was dancing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Amazing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Brilliant, got your fix</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep I did a class, Stella was teaching advanced I did intermediate
Did yo want to talk for a few minutes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>phone is out of charge
and internent in hotel is dodgy
main thing tonight is that I hung out with Steven and we went to Korean BBQ</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Are you ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>which for him was a treat
mostly OK Julia
We talked about good things
but he also back slides into bad things
I can see this court stuff is really waying him down, but it is another issue that I really worry about for him
but, doing something like Korrean BBQ was great
he does not ever do that sort of stuff (well not since living with me)
so tomorrow, we will meet for 9am
do some things in the city, have another banquet of some sort (probabally yum cha)
he opens up a lot when we are just doing that sort of stuff
what was the best part of your night Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>All the guys I danced with are so open to connecting and seem surprised and really grateful at the end.
A lot of the Latin Junction crew came along so it was nice to have a dance with everyone,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thats good, I would have enjoyed it
I like dancing with the LJ crew
sorry, my internet keeps dieing here</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok have a good night,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I miss you Julia
I think I will go to sleep now,
Good night sweetheart xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I miss you to and connecting after a dance
On the human coach</div>
<div class='bubble david '>mmmmmm, brings a smile to my face thinking about it</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I love you David and miss being close to you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I also think about sleeping with you,
I mean laying with you in my arms, or waking up with you and spooning
and nibbling your ears
and kissing your neck
I just want to hold you against my body</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes well it's hard in a car, but we will one day</div>
<div class='bubble david '>yes, we will</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Human coach is good and I'm reading up on Tantra
Intreasting</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I would love you to tell me more when we see each other
Love you Julia, I wish for you to have beautiful dreams, I hope that you wake up with flowing energy and that you have an inciteful meditation in the morning.
Good night sweetheart

<h2>29-05-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David , I slept a full 8 hrs deeply and I feel amazing , I had a slight sour throat but after my practice it seemed to of cleared, as yoga pushes and squeezes all my organs helping the crap that stagnates whist sleeping shift and clear.
This has been a week of mentle healing the monkey chatter in my head has gone for the first time in a long time.
Over the past two years I've been scraping back my past canvas, a amateur painting of my life, caked on with everyone else's influences but non of my own choice of colours and composition the results of a student learning.
My blank canvas has its first layer of paint with the encouragements from the people who Give me true love and the people I now choose to surround me that serve me in allowing to be who I really am I am so grateful for them , David you are one of these people that has shown and held a mirror up to me so that I can see the confident woman I am and I am going to become something amazing because of that, I love you being apart of my life ??????</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Beautiful writing sweetheart,  i will respond later if I can. I am with Steven at a pancakes place. Same chain as pancakes by the rocks
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It seems like that is a poet living inside you
Your writing this morning has soul, it has depth. I can picture the old practice canvas. Its like walking into a high school art class where you have to use the brushes and paints that look like they are years old and never really cared for
I can also see this new canvas and how you are painting it with magic and layering down strokes of love and light
I read your writing and it ignites my own passion, I can wax lyrical in response to your writing
Have a goid morning</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>During my meditations I have visions some  don't make sense but then they crystallise once connection occurs,  i made a connection this  morning that had little nuances leading up to the connection the vision of what I've seen is huge super excited David????????????

<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,
I hope you easy sleep last night,  i know that talking about Steven brought some negative energy into the space but I am thankful that you allowed me to share sime of what is going on with him.
All in all, I had a good and positive  time with him and that would not have happened without your suggestion to go there.
Today I have a huge amount of work including getting some paperwork ready for accountant.
I'm in a good focused position this morning.
Good luck with all your bank work  today, hope your cold recedes as well.
If you are well and we see each other tonight,  i will keep the energy light for you.
Have a wonderful day Julia

<div class='bubble julia '>I can't remember the last time I  soaked in a bath, I'll have one tonight with great pleasure with the candle you bought me and will also  use your beautiful soap xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Great, self care sounds just in order for you
I'm glad my little gifts are there for you
I am feeling a wistful at the moment
it has been some time since I kissed you and I long a little for holding you, looking into your beautiful eyes, and just gently kissing your cheek and your lips
I love the feeling of letting my lips press tightly around your top or bottom lip and just hold and suck on your lip, and let my tongue press against you
and I love to hold your in embrace while doing that and running my fingers through your hair
Get well sweetheart so I can spend time with you tomorrow night
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My god David I'm going to really enjoy my bath tonight with your words hmmm good night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good night</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I can't see the sticker
Now I see, see you tomorrow night xo
May 31</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning little Goddess
Dancing was great last night,  i did level 4 & 5 which were challenging and fun and in level 3 I was a follow which is good for me
I've found this YouTube TV show that I have been finding a lot of inspiration from.  This is the link to this mornings video. https://youtu.be/OaF_sph4k7Y
I want to wake up every day energised and full of life and to immerse myself in the lightness of life, to be a fun person to be around,  to be an attractive soul to others. Someone that helps bring the best out of the people I'm around
I I I I I
I talk about 'I' a lot
The way the guy on the link above signs of is tha 'We' are all in this together
I'm going to be spending my morning on way to work sending my love,  my light and my energy to your heart
My body is already tingling just through the connection I feel with you Julia
Hope you are feeling  better this morning.
Love you princess xo</div>

<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David, good morning.
I had a great night, soaking in a bath is something I need to do once a week to wind down, I have been so stressed, mum and I had a really good chat about the future of our business, The retreat, proposal that I'll send to Sanjay this week. Reki and Om is all I can manage this morning as my body is crying for physical rest and recovery, lying in the bath looking at my body I have noticed massive changes from 5 months ago, I love my body not in an ego way, with mindful eating and yoga it reflects the care I have given to it, I have shed my old self physically to a new body.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>seems like the caterpillar's cocoon is all but gone

It is my version of meditation

<div class='bubble julia '>I feel uncomfortable I will not be messaging you anymore</div>
<div class='bubble david '>is it because I sexualized the message this morning?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I don't think i can do this anymore.
I have a meeting to go to</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Can we at least talk at some time about this?
after work tongith?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>David I have honoured you as a dance partner with respect , I have had the upmost respect for you. I know now what a relationship with you will be like and in my personal circumstances I cannot continue down that path.
I am bake peddling as or intimacy will always be on a public domain and it has not been honoured a couple of times., I love you I respect you I can only commit to you as a dance partner. To much is at stake in my personal life to go any further with you. I don't trust you in my sacred space, it has been published already to much I feel very  vaunrabl very exposed like I do in the parks with you. It's not what I want right now
You are already juggling a lot of woman who are relying on your support focus your energy on them they have children think about what's going to be the best choices for those children and the mothers that care for them,
I have a little girl that I teach on a Tuesday nights I let her mum pick her up 20 minuets later then the rest of the student because she is a single mum with A four month old and and older sibling she has seperate do recently and is working having to take the baby to work with her, the whole family sleep in one bed , the little girl is so beautiful and her mum is trying so hard under the circumstances, I am happy to help her were I can.
I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't feel comfortable I feel uneasy it doesn't feel right .</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks for sharing that
I do still hope you will allow as to chat about this in person rather then just text,
We have gone through this once before and it creates distress for me being in a place of limbo without real understanding.
I would at least like the opportunity to talk with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Would I be able to come over the bridge somewhere safe for you later after you do all your family stuff</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Can we talk on the phone about it ?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>If that is how it must be then yes, but I would prefer to talk face to face, to understand your emotions around this
I could meet you near milsons point or somewhere comfortable for you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Phone call today is the only option</div>
<div class='bubble david '>ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'll call you now
Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>FYI, I have deleted message on my side, from both web and mobile phone it looks like this
http://screencast.com/t/tz8ggtHAf0v
I don't think it affects your side, but you have the ability to delete on your side as well, if there is anything else you want me to delete, just let me know and I will find it
I can fix past, but I can fix that</div>

You have been a big part of helping me heal.
I will be going back over our written journey and transfer it into hard copy into my journal to remind me of our connection I will be deleting our digital record.
I am not ready as you we understand now for anything more than dancing with you David and yesterday clarified that for me, you are a dear and gentle friend that I will always have a soft spot for in my heart.
We have a lot of work to do in our lives and it is time now to get focused on the task at hand,
I look forward to connecting with you in the future on the dance floor a place that we know we can go to when we feel down to relax, enjoy and laugh. A wonderful part of my life that I always look forward to dancing with you??????</div>

It's that case of always going somewhere in search for something and in actual fact everything that you need is at your doorstep.
Hi
Another observation your skin tone suits the landscape colours
Silver grey dark blue black
Even the sap green</div>
<div class='bubble david '>During my mediation I was thinking about a marketing option for you to both keep you inspired, connected to your local community and bring in business.
You could do a series of videos around techniques for painting sunrises, put them on skill share.
Then you could do a free (or cost of material workshop for 30 minutes) every month down on the rotunda where you teach people to paint what they see.
Be a good way to bring in new target market people to ArtBox.
Especially mums with kids
its interesting that you saw that in the photo, the pinks in my face matches the sunrise and my poncho matches the ocean
I did not think about that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep sounds good but I'm thinking of spreading my wings to regional areas getting sponsorship I will go to regional areas aboriginal communities and run workshops teaching how to use materials that they don't usually inspired by the local flora and fauna ebook and social media of my journey then Talbot workshops for of that exsprianse
Experience I'll talk later about it,
I have to go</div>
<div class='bubble david '>(y)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I'll talk to you about skin tone this will help you when decided what to buy clothing and what colours to choose</div>
<div class='bubble david '>(y), see you at 4pm at neutral bay</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm making a little picnic for us</div>
<div class='bubble david '>for today?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Some things you haven't truest
Tried
Yes afternoon tea</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I will try to get away at 3:15, be there at 3:30-3:45, I really need to get on the road by about 4:30 so I can avoid some of the peak hour</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok
Hey it's raining can you call me and pick me up in your car , we could go down to Wendy's secret garden they have sheltered picnic tables,
Or I could drive down and pick you up from ferry or train</div>
<div class='bubble david '>lets go with that?,[ pick me up at milsons point and then drop me back to your palce
my car is near you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am going to try and get away a little early</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Give me 45 min notice</div>
<div class='bubble david '>maybe 3, depends how much I get done in the next hour
ok
I plan to leave right on 3pm, I should be at milsons point at about 3:15pm, but I will send you another message as my train arrives, it takes about 7 minutes to go over the bridge,
I will meet you on the Vibe Hotel (Milsons Point) side of the station</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Vibe hotel ?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Opposite Milssons Point Side of station</div>

Have a great weekend, I loved our time together, I feel so much better.
See you for a Dance Sunday</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi Julia, I just wanted to say that you make me happy and I always leave you with a smile on my dial.
I love your secret garden, i can imagine having some little dinner dates there with you.
Have a good dance tonight xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes I would love to have some dinner dates, it has a beautiful energy, the love that Wendy has put into that garden is amazing, I used to have a permaculture garden and got so much pleasure from gardening
I'm heading in for a dance now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Have fun</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hello
You finished</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep
It was fun</div>
<div class='bubble david '>??
Good</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>How the retreat</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You need your therapy
Its been goid
We had a meeting
And just finished up with social gathering
Just walked up to my room now
Will get up and do a 615 walk with the others tomorrow
I can't explain what this sort of retreat does for me
But i already know it will be very good for me</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah it's your vibe</div>
<div class='bubble david '>So much
I was just talking with this women for last 30 minutes
And her story is off the wall a bit
But so relatable
So twll me about dancing
Good leads?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes but I like bachata with you
It's an intimate dance</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah
I know what you mean</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I connect deeper with you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>That's why I am looking forward to you learning kizoomba</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's why I love it
Yeah
I was thinking about what we talked about today</div>
<div class='bubble david '>How so</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>You make me feel good David
And I do need to be patient
And mindful of being reactive</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Why am I scared
Sometimes I imagine shit that's not there</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But do know that i keep my spiritual program up and i will ride your waves.
I dobt know if you have noticed but i rarely react to your stuff with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you, you are what I need now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I dont criticise, defend or blame</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>In my life</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I might have words to my sponsor or friends. Eg tian
Cause i need to release my own presure
Or at least have someone see through my own shit or delusions</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I also wool be going away some weekends
I need to be strong within myself as we know when shit hits the fan it's only yourself that is left to deal with it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes
When you say away on weekends . Do you mean retreat
Ir work
Or work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>My life in a marriage is over
I'm working out what my future relationships are
Or what I want</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I understand,  you need freedom,  you need self exploration
You need that experience without worrying about hiw I might feel or feeling co trolled</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>And I'll talk through next time and not shut down and push away</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Im not looking to tie you down Julia, and i need my own freedom too.
One thing i do want</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Is regular date nights</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Dancing?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Today in the secret garden is what i consider a date night
Something where we do things that are different or fun or intimate</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Dancing is part of who we are
But i also want to explore the limits of who we are</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>What else do you like doing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Surfing, bush walking, plays, art, yoga
Who care about what i like</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Cool</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Its about the experience
Of sharing
We will try things and not like them</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Camping?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Sure
Anything</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You have helped open my world this year
And thats what I want to do for you
Enough of a controlling marriage for you
Enough of a bland life for me
I want to live life with passion
And i want to explore that passion with you
If all we did was dancing
It would soon get stale</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok let's do other things, but I do love to dance it would never get stale</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Dinner at secret garden</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I have a simple little date idea for next Saturday at 5pm if you are free
And with that date idea, i have dancing to close the night
So even if what we do is not the best
I have a fallback  (never fail) option in place</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Alternating weekends when Sebastian is with his Dad I'm free</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok
So is he with dad this weekend</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>OK and the weekends. Are they a no go, or is there flexibility</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>What do you mean
The weekends Sebastian is with me I look after him</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok
Understand
So you will not really be free at all on those weekends</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No he needs me</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>When he is older he will have sleep overs
And other stuff
He comes first</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know
I totally expect that</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But I hope you don't mind if i sometimes ask to steel you away for an hour here or there from time to time.</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah fear of trust</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Do you think a lot of this is about Peter
Or other</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
I need to be mindful of that</div>
<div class='bubble david '>OK. I can't undo that issue in you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It will take time</div>
<div class='bubble david '>But I try to act with integrity and respect with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I can't just switch off</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I get it
Time takes time</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Did you have a shower</div>

I get that trust for you will be earned
Are cold
You
Have you gotten wet coming home</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Sorry for comparing
No I have had a shower and in bed</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Your comparing subconsciously

Im just pointing out what you are doing through questions
First step to change is knowing what the problem really is</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thanks David I need that</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Saying that you are sorry,  is like saying your sorry when you make a mistake on dance floor
I dont need to hear it
I love dearly Julia</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>I would love to have a spiritual connection with you
When we are together</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I've just been writing poetry and I like where it is going but I've just hit a mental block on it and when I saw the word kundalini, it got me thinking in a new direction for this poem
I like how the website asks the question
What if you could unlock your creative potential
I would love to explore spiritual connection with you
I have spent the last hour in a spiritual connection with you already
That's what I love about poetry,  i get to see you in a whole new light</div>

<div class='bubble david '>Can you do me a favor. Would you be able to ask Felix to email the photos of us

<div class='bubble david '>Sure</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Did you see them?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>No</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm not into studio shots,
I love more natural black and white
I worked with Paul for a few years and travelled over seas assisting a photographer for three months in America
We can make some much nicer photos
I would prefer</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Can we do them without a photographer</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Can we use timed photos
I would like some natural environment photos with you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes natural light is the best</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Like down at secret garden or on harbour</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes
Perfect
Sunset with warm glow is the best light
Not direct
Over cast</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You said you wanted to also look at the colors I wear</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Don't wear white
Sorry I mean there are colours that suit you
And some that won't work
You suit silver</div>

<div class='bubble julia '>Grey blue like your eyes
Black is great</div>

I need some idea of what I whant</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Let's do birkenhead point if we can and maybe do a bay walk
Or nice lunch down there</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Sounds great</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I have to go Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I just rotated my wardrobe yesterday from summer to winter

Hi</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hi</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just laying in bed how's your day been
Have a good night
June 5</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia
Apologies fir nit replying last night.  Phone was not charging properly when i got back to room
I liked that gap photo as well.  Plus the photo in front of the shop window with the female models
You will have to explain to ne about the pantone color
I'm just laying in bed now and its quite peaceful with rain falling  down outside
Had some good one on one time with my friend Jackie, who is a psychologist. She challenged my thinking around a few of my challenges and that was good
One if the meetings yesterday got me thinking about how irrelevant the challenges in life really are. Every other month there is a challenge, every other year there is a big challenge that seems dramatic.
So long as I am living in the moment,  living in flow, living in gratitude.
So long as I am always trying to do the next right thing. Pray for guidance, sit in meditation.
I can keep my cool, no matter what storm is going around me
I think my day will finish here fairly early. 1 or 2 i think.  Then i will start driving back to Sydney
You have been on my mind a lot this weekend,
Its good to sit in the warm glow I feel when I think if you

Synergy is what happens when one plus one equals ten or a hundred or even a thousand! It's the profound result when two or more respectful human beings determine to go beyond their preconceived ideas to meet a great challenge.

<div class='bubble david '>Something to start your day off with
Sitting on the Train, I reminisce this night.
Outside the sky pours rain, inside my heart takes flight
For the girl with stunning smile, tonight we had our dance
For her I'd swim the nile, or take her on a sailing trip to France.
And and as I Glyde through Edgecliff station, recalling time with her tonight
I think she's God's gift to creation, a being of wonder, love and light.
As the Bondi Junction train pulls in, and I'm nearly to my door
I've walked the whole way with a grin, grateful for the angel I adore.

The m40</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok
Is it regular</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yeah</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>See you  in 2min</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know what the problem was with my scattered mind when I dropped you off at dancing.
Your presence is so intoxicating.
Being around you sometimes feels like taking drugs, but not the man made ones. Instead it is the drug of oxitocin, the love drug that your body naturally releases.
It feels great but some a little disorienting.
Well I was happy to walk you to the door. Hope you have a great night dancing and say Hi to Ben and Gen</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you David for the bus ride, loved it and didn't miss much of my class</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hey Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi David how was your meeting</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It was great
You finished establishment</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes at bus stop</div>
<div class='bubble david '>How was the dancing</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hung out with Ben, it was nice connecting with him, we had a few dances it helps to ground him</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I had two pages printed of an article you sent me a few weeks ago about healthy relationships. It is such a good read.  I would like to read it with you some time when you are on the couch  (ie me)</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I would love to when?</div>

June 8</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi
How was your meeting?
Thank you for spending the time with me this afternoon, and showing me your workspace,</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Hello</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Kizoomba is amazing I love it I'm going to get a years membership with tropical sol. , such a deep connection, I wish I was doing it with you tonight. We were doing a  choreography in level 4 that they will film next week</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Where are you now
Travelling
Or home</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes on train
Where are you?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Just got home
Meeting was good
I was asked to speak for 5 minutes</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>And how did it go
Are you ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Its good
You sometimes seem to worry about me
Why? Do i give of that sort of energy</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No I just care
It's hard to distinguish the tone on messinger</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm all good and just understand that meetings are part of my spiritual blood stream
I am going to look forward to Tuesday and Wednesday meetings</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>That's great</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It will be good for my emotional sobriety
And being picked up after your drumming will be good</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Spending time with you like this evening is always great for me
Even just riding the bus with you
I hope you will be able to do regular level 1 and 2 kizoomba with me
I would love that to be our dance
How did you go with level 4</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>IKizoomba is amazing I love it I'm going to get a years membership with tropical sol. , such a deep connection, I wish I was doing it with you tonight. We were doing a  choreography in level 4 that they will film next week</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Very cool</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Not sure low profile</div>
<div class='bubble david '>?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'll  finish my drumming course and lick you up
Pick
Ha ha
A bit of both
My tummy has had a good work out tonight</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You will lick me up
Hmmm</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I don't want to be in a video for Kizoomba yet</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I would like to do that for you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>If I am I want to be with you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>How come with video
Because not with me or other</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Bachata is fine Kizoomba I'll do later when I get more in tune with it
Was thrown in the deep end</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm sure you were</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just want to feel and connect with the style more the basic steps
We could practice together</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Well I think the real pleasure in kizoomba is in the foundations</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It would be great for that and tantra awsome sex</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Not the moves</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes and my kundalini chakra is on fire now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>What we did the last 2 weeks with the movement exercises is really connected
I bet</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Not to mention working my pelvic floor
I'll be big time I can feel it</div>
<div class='bubble david '>There is that. But also dancing chest to chest and with connection at the head as well</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I had my eyes closed tonight most of the time</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Its a whole body love affair with your partner and i want that to be our dance</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>The guys love feeling the muscles in my back when I move</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I want that physical,  emotional and spiritual connection as we move to the music
Just let me know whenever you want to practice</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes I want that slow
Movement with you
Strengthening controlling
With my body
And connecting with you so powerful</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It's nice how spending just 10 minutes on chat with you leaves me warm, glowing and tingling</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I will move and feel sensual graceful</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes
I also think that mixing kizoomba in with slow batchata would be devine</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Can't wait David , but I will</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Its all part of journey
We will grow into this dance together</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Let's read through the notes you printed out about relationships</div>
<div class='bubble david '>We could do that on Sunday or maybe when I come back late Friday night from monavale</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I need to keep my head and body wanting you in sink,
How late Fridat?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>About 1030
But I will message you and if you are tired
We will leave it</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Kizoomba seems to have a much more powerful effect on my body after
Ok play by ear</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Are you on bus yet</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Im getting getting off the bus now have walk so I'll say goodnight
Xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>xo
Love you sweetheart,  i am going sleep now.  Will connect in morning</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>June 9</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Morning David I love your work structure that you shared with me last night, I felt so blissed out last night after Kizoomba, slept deep and woke up at 3 with some monkey chatter that was soon calmed and sorted with meditation now I have time to get a couple of hrs of my work done before taking care of others, have a great morning and look forward to more Kizoomba medicine tonight xo</div>

Thank you
That's for everyone
Do you think</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Don't mean to interrupt your morning.
It is</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes you got me side tracked</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Go back to work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>All good I'll take a break and get dressed</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am happy that you responded to the picture I sent, but I know when you are busy and I send those things so that you can have a smile in the middle of your hectic morning, not to pull you away from task.
When I send a little joke to you (no matter how childish), it is also just to give you a smile in the midst of busynes
--------------------------------------------------------
In response to "that's for everyone" I say yes and no. Inside every one is a perfect being of love, strength and light. There is a King or a Queen inside each of us.
But for the majority of people it is suppressed by cloud and fog.
I know for myself, the internal journey requires consistent investigation and effort.
I live in the 1st world, I'm time poor and bombarded by distractions and most people around me are just treading water in the struggle.
When I peer into the internal mirror of my soul it is caked with dust, grit and scum.
On a daily basis I need to make an effort to clean, to polish the mirror, the main tools for me is prayer, gratitude and service, but it is different for everyone, for others it maybe meditation or surfing or playing with a pet or child.
No the King and Queen is not for everyone, it is only for those who take action and quest for it.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I have served a lot of kings and queens in my hospitality life and I'm very familiar to the good and bad that goes with this position, I have seen how some that were graceful and honourable  with the position and I have seen some that had failed miserably. It a horrible sight when you see someone fall from greatness. Like in a game of chess the King and or queen are always a point of target.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I hear you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>But as for small buisness you can. Disguise yourself as a pawn by not being such a show of with material goods when really you are a queen  or king
Your not a target but part of a community
Or a number of communities better
More contemporary than the stuffy old monarchy</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm for knowing I'm a king at heart, whilst living in humility both inside and in how I represent myself to the community.
Unlike the game of chess though, I think the King and the Queen support each other and present a united front
The idea of partnership (I'll use the word marriage, but I understand that term is a little antiquitated)
My wife depends on me and I depend on her, we support each other. That's how marriage is supposed to work.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Not sure</div>
<div class='bubble david '>its another point of discussion for us then

<div class='bubble julia '>Tonight was hard
I just need to reflect a bit
On my own
Saturday</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Goid Morning Julia,
I just wanted to make sure you awoke to a positive frequency.
This is a piem for you.
I call it "5 Rythyms"
Tonight I danced the elements five
And there I danced my angel alive
As i moved my feat while the  music pumped
From the earth I felt her heartbeat thump
A wind arose, blowing skirt of lace
And there she stood, what beauty, what grace?
From my loins arose a fire that flared
To entwine this girl, to feel us paired.
She offered a cup of water sublime,
She kissed my lips, this goddess devine.
Said the radiant spirit, let our hearts merge together.
I looked in her eyes, said I'll love you forever.
Saturday</div>
</div>

This is a testing time and and thank god if it was not for my meditation and yoga a  Julia bomb would have landed on this household. I am taking on your gratitude way of thinking whilst I navigate my emotions , taking a breath and observing calmly is essential. It will be intrasting as my more interactions with Peter today I am shifting from my old ways of reacting, which I'm grateful for , good morning. David I hope you have a wonderful day  xo</div>

I Love you Julia and proud to be on this journey with you

How was your meeting</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Great</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Are you in Kirribilli</div>
<div class='bubble david '>No
Waverly
Are you going to establishment</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>No</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Are you ok</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Just had a birthday dinner, everyone loved your flowers, thank you they are opening beautifully</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Who's birthday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm good now
Melisha a old friend of the family the one I do taro with
Yeah mum and I had a chat</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Happy to hear that you are better now
I hope you and her are getting more clarity</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Sorry I typed a few things , basically a work in progress
The bonus is I am inspired by the situation to work harder on my business, and set things up so when I move into my own place I have a good  buisness foundation set up. Loads of work I, need to just get focused
Whilst Sebastian is away I would really like to work this weekend, though the thought of indulging with you this weekend is so tempting, just to run and hide in your arms for a couple of days. Not to think about anything but us would be woundful</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Be mindful that you and i have not had an opportunity to connect like we could this weekend and due to the nature of both our lives we can't just do that anytime we like</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yes it is a rare opportunity</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know you are driving and striving for your business and i understand that but if we miss this weekend I hope we won't have to wait a couple more months</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok David I need the break, i was planing a retreat and was putting that off, let's go and take care of each other</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks
I will look after you this weekend
And then you can come home and throw yourself at your work</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I'm excited now
Yep sounds great, looking forward to it
Thank you David</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thank you Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Did you want me to pick you up tomorrow night?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Yes
I hope my messages today came at the right time
I sensed that you were challenged
I did not call because I guess you would connect if needed
But I want you to know that I will always try to support you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It did David , Mum is tough woman and I don't want to rock the boat
We are going to have regular coffee meetings wends day morning</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Sounds appropriate</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Any how some of the domestic stuff is a bit ridiculous such as she wants to have a time slot that I will be in the kitchen to make breakfast for Sebastian and I as she feels there is not enough room for three in the kitchen
Hey what did you talk about tonight</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Phone died</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok</div>
<div class='bubble david '>It is on charge
But it needs tine
It will die any moment

<div class='bubble david '></div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '></div>
<div class='bubble julia '>David I love you, that has not changed. I am changing and growing.
I am inspired by upheaval at home to work harder on my goals
I had set out to do ,
My sister is my inspiration, my mum is my inspiration
They challenge me to become better
I know they love me as they are tough with  me
They know I can take it
I have purpose with a goal and a time limit of 6 months
My sister is blazing a trail for me
My mum and John have set me a foundation, I have what I need to be anything I dream of being
I'm now at a point in my life to live the life I was always dreaming of when I was stuck in my marriage
I'm going to honour that gift given to me as I have spent the past to years fighting for it , it's time to. Take action and not waist the opportunity presented to me. My son has been my first source of inspiration  , I am being my best for him
Good night David xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>xo
Thursday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, I love you,
during my practice I was thinking of you and the beautiful poems you had spent the time to write to me, you have helped me so much to feeling confident in myself,
I thank you for letting me face my fears sexually you have helped me free my mind o those fears, I thank you for our conversations and our no bullshit honesty with each other. I love you for that I didn't mean to make you feel guilty about the time with you is taking me away from my time with my friends, this was sa. Observation that I have the power to change with no fault to you only for me to make the responsibility to make time for my circle of friends.
You inspire me with your commitment to your friends and I should do the same as one of the issues I have done in past relationships is give my heart body and sole to my relationship and this is not good, I need to hold my energy, I need to hold my focus on the goals I want to a have  in my life I need to be mindful and make a point of scheduling phone call time with my friends, I want to share beautiful moments with you with dance and have the freedom to move with you on a deeper level, when the opportunity presents itself .
The car is becoming a habit I'm a bit ashamed of to tell you the truth. It something I don't want to base or intimacy on
I will tell you why, when the Windows steam up and I'm facing the back of the car I can see handprints of my son, let alone the car seat, that is why I feel ashamed after</div>

Oops David Cat doesn't want you to come to the Kirtain tomorrow night, something happened, whilst you were dating her?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Wow really</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yep she just messaged me now</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thats interesting, but I guess understandable. The only thing that ever happened whilst dating was that she found someone and did not want to continue dating</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hmm strange
Maybe a boundary thing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Could be. I personally found it a little unsettling myself to be at world bridgers with her there
I would imagine it is much worse for her</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Sure, I would still like to go as quite a few of my friends are going and I really need to connect with that group

<div class='bubble julia '>Alchemical magic this second FULL MOON in Sagittarius coinciding with the SOLSTICE, on 20/21 June. ~ Both SUN and MOON at their peak align to bring us illumination of the patterns that need to be rewoven within our own psyche, within our relationships and within the greater collective Reality. The arrow of Truth is swift and on point bearing the way. On this �FULL MOON SOLSTICE� day, take time to be still and connect your heart to the beating, pulsing heart of the cosmos. Like our ancestors before us, we are reminded that we are part of it, an intrinsic part of the cosmic weave �It�s been a very confusing time for many and with the second Full Moon in Sadge illuminating the skies there is a big energy up around personal and collective Truth which necessarily requires that we also look at personal and collective delusion, deception, illusion and denial. �This Full Moon is at 29�32 Sagittarius- activating the karmic completion degree which occurs at the last degree of every sign� �So we have this image of not only chapters completing but perhaps a whole volume of life ending. �The Sun/Moon opposition straddles the 29th degree of Gemini and Sadge- showing that major crisis points, completions and endings are occurring in regards to our perception of Truth and our capacity to live aligned by it�� �The desire to escape is strong right now and yet the path of mastery requires we stay the course, stay embodied and show up to do the work. �It�s interesting to note that the Sun/Moon opposition is not the only activation of the karmic completion degree. �We also have Juno, the asteroid Goddess of partnership and marriage, at 29 Libra�� �Juno essentially comes to a standstill at 29 Libra- so from now until July 7th we are in deeply karmic territory in relationships, commitments and contracts in our lives. There are definite major karmic completions going on right now. �Whether significant relationships are ending for good or longtime karmic patterns of relating to others is what is ending (or both)- there�s some deep stuff to navigate in the realm of relationships�� �Libra is the sign of the scales which brings to mind the justice card in the tarot. Right now the scales are being rectified- with all parties needing to account for their part in things in order for healing or closure to happen. �Navigate this month wisely- and focus on completing karmic patterns you are finally good and ready to leave behind!� �Another layer of energy gets added in when we notice that Juno is journeying with Black Moon Lilith right now as well. They conjoined on May 29th and will do so again on September 11th�� �With Juno traversing with BML we also have an interesting juxtaposition of the Goddess of commitment and the Dark Goddess of freedom and independence. �With both in underworld Scorpio there can be big shadows up right now around fear of engulfment (BML shadow) or fear of abandonment (Juno shadow) and the things we do to avoid feeling all the emotions that arise when either of this are experienced�� �To add to the relational focus we have Venus, the Goddess of Love and beauty, conjunct the Sun and opposite the Full Moon- so we have another indicator that we are being asked to redress imbalances in relationships�� �Luckily Venus trines Black Moon Lilith in Scorpio- bringing a deeply psychic, intuitive, spiritual and magical energy into the chart. �Add in the trine to Neptune in Pisces and we have a Grand Water Trine formed between the lower heart (Venus), the Higher Heart (Neptune) and the fierce Dark Feminine (Lilith). �When we can access deep compassion and unconditional Love and at the same time see beyond the facade of the ego to get to the heart of the Truth� no matter how dark or hidden or wounded that Truth may be- then real healing can happen. �The Full Moon is also in a wide trine to Uranus, Eris and Ceres- a triple conjunction of the Rebel and Revolutionary, the Goddess of upheaval and chaos and the Great Mother asteroid Goddess of loss and renewal�� �Uranus comes in like wild fire- clearing out what is no longer valid and supportive for our growth. Eris is similar in nature- she throws the apple of discord into our lives to show us what is out of integrity and needing to be faced and addressed. �And Ceres is in there to support us in moving through the transitional spaces of loss and renewal so we don�t get stuck in the birth portal between death of the old and birth of the new. �Luckily the ruler of this lunation is Jupiter- the planet of expansion, growth and positivity. His alignment with the evolutionary north node is bringing in MAJOR POTENTIAL for new growth, evolution and positive change (Jupiter aligns with the mean north node on June 24th). �Add in Pluto in Capricorn�s trine to both Jupiter (June 26th) and the North Node (June 16th) and we can see that this portal of time from June 16th to the 26th is POWERFUL. �It�s a potent time of manifestation and actualization- but the key to make it work the most for you is that you have to be very clear on what you are calling in/anchoring into and you have to be very clear on what you are leaving behind�� �I leave you with Ellias Lonsdale�s Star Sparks meditation for the last degree of Sagittarius: �There is an assignment, a destiny task which falls to me. I am asked to take each and every situation I come into and to witness the pattern, the design, the way it goes. Then I release it through me. �I take everything that has been and I let it all go. Sometimes this is very arduous. Other times it is instantaneous, effortless. It doesn�t matter. Whatever way it is, I�ll be there. �I am fascinated and engrossed in the human dilemma, the soul drama. I have an endless appetite for putting things together and taking them apart. But I am very serious and intent in all that I do. �It is one of those tasks that is almost too crucial to let myself be aware of. I don�t want to get in the way. So I pretend it�s just the way I pass time. I act as casual and cool as possible, even with myself. Oddly enough, it works. �The truth is, though, that there is nothing more vital than what I do. Because I�m around, things move differently. I�m a cross between a catalyst and a loyal follower of the existing pattern as long as I possibly can. �My impulse is to preserve, if possible. When that�s not happening, I will get in there and make it obvious that this is not the way the flow is supposed to go. �I am immensely powerful and deeply hidden. I work between the lines. But I am so good at what I do. I can spend extended cycles in the outlandish assignments. And I will look and act straight the whole while. �I�ve got a job to do. I am witnessing the whole thing but sometimes you just gotta pay close attention to the weave.� (~ Ellias Lonsdale from his Star Sparks) � Copyright 2016 DIVINE HARMONY http://www.mysticmamma.com/full-moon-in-sagittarius-solstice-june-20th-2016/ art: The Star Child Tarot, http://www.thehoodwitch.com/blog/2015/9/21/starchild-an-interview-with-danielle-noel
Sacred Dreams
Yeah it's great feel totaly buzzing after the five rites I love you David and that your looking after yourself.
I felt a lot of compressions with lymphatic good series of exercises to get started with and quick 21 repeats of each 15 min
Tuesday</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I was reading about that Sagittarius alignment last night anoth friend on Facebook had posted a similar article
Good morning Julia
Im glad i am looking after myself to
I know its because I have a degree of self love that I have not had for some time
But there is also an amplification of that self love from the energy I feel around you
I am often give out my own energy in relationships but too often the woman I have been in relationship with have been energy vampires
I find it is far more bio directional with you
I love that you seem to have a healthy balance between holding yourself in a contained state and also giving selflessly
My biggest lesson this year has been around staying grounded in relationship . There has been some little storms this last few months and i have mostly held my own containment during those periods
I have shared my emotional insecurities with my sponsor or other spiritual advisors and that has helped me to be objective and tap into a wisdom i would nit find on my own
It has also allowed me to be far less reactive or to share negative emotions with you, thus helping me to hold appropriate internal boundaries
I don't know what our future holds, but does not matter too much at the moment as i have found living in the moment with you both easy and rewarding
I  know we don't write as much here anymore but I personally find this journaling to be healthy
Have a wonderful day Squeeky ;)
Love you xo</div>

I wish you good dreams
And sending my love to you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good night David
Xo
Friday</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,  it's nice waking up while dreaming about you. Many good memories from last night, looking at you in that blue jumper and thinking you look cute, holding your hand while witnessing our amazing city through martin place and hyde park, practicing dance in Hyde park, sitting on a park bench while you pour me some tea, watching your ass undulate in kizoomba,  dancing during class and especially feeling your boonda flowing in rhythm while my eyes were closed with you in my arms and finishing the night with you in my lap with long kisses, cheek brushing and breath exchanges. I feel so good with you Julia
I am grateful and blessed to have such a beautiful person in my life and I love our little adventures. I look forward to seeing you tonight.
Have a wonderful day princess xo
Friday</div>
</div>
<h2>24-06-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David I love having  a journal record of each of our nights spent together. FYI I haven't deleted any of our messenger record , only the explicit stuff that I prefer to remember as an intimate connection rather than in writing, as it then becomes something that I am uncomfortable with.
I'm looking forward to tonight I'm wearing a skirt for the occasion. ??
I have a studio full of women so I won't connect until this afternoon .xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>(y)
love you, have a great day
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hey David I'll bring ginger tea, I think it helps as you seemed not to cough last night after you were drinking it. Just having a quick lunch break, I hope you have a great afternoon xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Thanks for the message</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>See you soon</div>
<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>Something that I notice about you all the time is that you are a hidden beauty right in front of my eyes, uncomplicate and animated, you are a joy to be around, an inspiration to my soul and a precious gem that never ceases to dazzle
Apparently you can find wabi sabin in Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>And I see it in you David
Though with the last quote photo I sent I think he was talking about the superficial self improvement what we share is our a hunger to grow from our past mistakes heal and to make spiritually nourishing choices. To offer to the world now understanding our boundaries and our limitations so we don't crumble and break again, life lessons of personal boundaries is the gold that holds me together, with its shiny quality it is something to alway notice and celebrate rather than hide and resent. Xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Well said</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Alright back to my studio of ladies
Bye</div>
<div class='bubble david '>no worries
Oh BTW, you said earlier that you have kept our conversations here as your journal, I have taken that a little step further by writing some software to extract that information in to a data structure that can be processed into something else (not sure what that something else is yet), but it takes our FB messages and groups them by date and who said it.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok
Smarty pants ha ha</div>
<div class='bubble david '>http://screencast.com/t/5KY72auwlo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Can you code it with spell check on my behalf ha ha</div>
<div class='bubble david '>haha, sure</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Wow that's an intense world you live in Matrix man</div>

<div class='bubble david '>Sorry
Forgot phone</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Saturday
Thank you for the date David I had a fun night, not sure what happened at the end but I couldn't open the door and your reaction threw me.</div>
</div>
<h2>25-06-2016</h2>
<div class='chat'>
<div class='bubble david '>I was thinking of it
I was in a degree of fear and shame around making love in the office
I was kind off beating myself up around it
My energy was very out of sorts at the end but i did not what to project any of it onto you</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I don't want to do that again at the end of the night
There's something else I'm sure in time</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I just want to remember the dinner
The play
The slow breaths and movement on the train platform
Its interesting that we can be fine being romantic in public or down on the beach. But in your car or my office and one of us freaks out</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Which one?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Which one of us freaked out tonight?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Me
Because its ny office
But you freak out when its your car
But i think the reasons are similar</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Yeah I guess we can't do that anymore as its totally deflated a fantastic energy we had all evening.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I know
We learnt something</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Why were you sneezing</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Don't know</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Ok good night</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good night
I just walked in door at home
I chose to remember the rest of the night, sleep well and have a good weekend with Sebastian. I hope drumming is fun
xo
Saturday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>I shared my energy with you David last night I can't change how I feel.I'll refill hopefully with yoga and enjoy my moments with Sebastian , it's served me before it will serve me again, last night confirmed the power of energy shifts. I'll be mindful of that from now on. Have a great day xo</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I am honoured that you shared your energy with me, i am grateful for the night we had.
I was also caught up in a shame spiral last night that was robbing me.
My language for that feeling is described in AA as the spiritual malady and is the true reason why I ever stayed in AA, because Alcoholism has nothing to do with alcohol, alcoholism is centered in the mind.
I'm happy you can refill on yoga,  i too will refill with a meeting this morning.
I am also driven to find a new home ASAP, I need to have my own space so that I can feel centered.
Thank you for all of last night, especially how the night ended. I say that not because I am happy in how it ended but because of the objective awareness that I could see around my own fears and shame.</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>David Thank god for my practice and thank god for for your open communication, thank god for messenger as with it we have a contract that reminds us of how not to repeat our fuck ups experience,  learn, reflect let go move forward and enjoy the new day with more knowledge of my boundry's as to what sucks and what refills.
I have freedom I have choices I choose I life that fills me not drains me, have a great meeting xx</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Im thankful for this journal to. You mentioned let go and move forward. Thats one of the challenges of an alcoholic. We have a common catch phrase called "let go, let God" because resentment  (at others or SELF) its what takes as out of the game real quick . Without my program i hold onto the feelings of last night for a period that is way longer then is healthy for me and thus perpetuating the shame spiral. The open communication of this journal gives me a powerful tool
Good day sweetheart and have a wonderful weekend
xo</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Treat after sex like after yoga the resting pose, it is the most important, if you just ejaculate then rush off and break that spiritual connection that's why I thought you had snorted some drugs as you were so disjointed  you changed so much it was really fucked up you were happy to spend the time to build up the connection regardless of of your boss coming in or not but when you came and even when we were dressed I couldn't open the door to use the bathroom you turned to me like I was an idiot for not being able to open it, that was fucked that was a total change in you.
Maybe you were showing me your true spirit, not something played out from tantra or regurgitated from Aand A</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm happy to communicate what was going on for ne but I think it will require verbal communication
Ket ne know if you are free to chat sometime
I found a lot of clarity around my behavior in my morning reflections
For my part, especially my reaction around opening the door, I am sorry
Like all "reactions", it was born from something deep seated</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>About to start my class I'll connect later tonight</div>
<div class='bubble david '>You are also entirely correct about the resting pose, im sorry about that aspect too
Ok
Saturday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>How did your meeting go?</div>

<div class='bubble david '>call me, I don't understand?</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Like magazines it's going airbrushed, played out presented in a manner that is not raw and true as it was befor , it may loose it's raw spirit with the polishing, what do you think?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>Can i call</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Hi thanks for the call David
Just for the record for messenger
Communication between us has been a point in my life of navigating a new world after the trauma of divorce.
It has been an intense few months
That I have grown stronger from.
I hope you honour my wishes as discussed on the phone. Hard copy I prefer of our communication , pleas destroy the digital record.
Pleas respect these documents  as confidential.
I know you enjoy our interaction on messenger, coming from a space of a person that has overcome his trauma, in a private and confidential space such as A and A and therapy
Please respect my wishes for privacy of my healing period this is a time that I had mostly navigated by my intuition by my heart by my spiritual guides, pleas respect the sacred space it deserves on hard copy away from the digital world.</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I will respect your wishes Julia</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Thank you</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I'm still not sure yet how to print it for you
when I paste it into word
it comes out at 686 pages</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Holy shit</div>
<div class='bubble david '>I have to see if I can create smaller sized (compact file for printing)
I can make it smaller, but it will require me to write a different output file, with a different format
I can't do it today, but I will do it</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>It's ok, it doesn't have to happen today
Did you want a lift?</div>
<div class='bubble david '>With client at glebe

<div class='bubble julia '></div>
<div class='bubble david '>Good morning Julia,  i hope that every morning when you wake there is something from me to leave a smile on your face and warmth in your heart.
This morning I want to gift you my latest poem.
I call it "Julia's Place"
She invited me softly, come into my sacred place,
Such beauty,  so lovely, with elegance and taste.
As bright as a star, she gives me such hope,
Dave ... Don't mess it up; Just don't be a dope.
Cause when we dance,  she is my cure,
I love this romance, so gentle, so pure.
When I make her laugh,  she chimes like a bell,
and when she smiles, my heart starts to swell.
But alas I'm not perfect,  I know I have shadow,
Said the wise woman once, BEWARE; the raven card tarot.
So I take on each day, I strive for my light,
Pursuing this dream, to the grave I will fight.
For now I have purpose, I will never hesitate,
For she is my reason, my beautiful soul mate.
xo
Tuesday</div>
<div class='bubble julia '>Good morning David, had a wonderful meditation, I brought the abundance of universal energy of white light in and than  visualised the abundant energy overflowing from the top of my head and raining down to my feet in gold like a water fall around my body, then projected the abundant universal energy to all of whom I love including you, i prayed that you find your sacred space David xo</div>
