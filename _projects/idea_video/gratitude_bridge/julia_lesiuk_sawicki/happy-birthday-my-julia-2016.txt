Mon amour, mon Julia,

It would be ineffable to describe in words the joy and wonder that you bring to my life.

I appreciate daily the gift of your presence. Each morning I awake with a song in my heart that makes any Kirtan seem infinitesimal, you help me to tackle life with increased energy and vigor, and you constantly remind me of what is beautiful in the world. 

Whenever I leave you, I feel empowered, I feel energised, I feel happy.

I love that we connect with intelligent conversation.
I appreciate how we share energy with each other. 
I look forward to our couch sessions.
I'm impressed with your ingenuity.
I respect that you are frugal, canny and resourceful.
I treasure your passionate and compassionate nature.
I admire the powerful role model you present to your son and the woman you associate with. 
I yearn for your beautiful body, your amazing eyes, your exquisite smile.
I warm to the ethereal softness of your face.
I feel at peace when I hear your mellifluous voice in song.
I vibrate with desire when we dance slow Kizomba.

It is never lost on me the serendipitous nature in which we came to connect.

This Journal is small token of my love, the letter, meager fare compared to the words in my heart, and the poem overleaf is but a simple gift for you.

I hope you fill this Journal with your art and that it brims with the light of your inner world.

Happy Birthday My Julia
