There's an energy in the air
The moon is bright with shine
My heart is full to brim
Blessed in life thats quite devine.

As I walk down by the quay
Deep in thought I am immersed
My girl,  I think she's sad tonight 
The gulls, they sing their verse

As I look beyond a ferry
Towards this girl who makes my day
I know shes up there sleeping
Warm in home at neutral bay

A message came to me tonight,
I could almost see the frown
I asked her if she is a-okay
She said "Im feeling down"

Well tonight I cannot cuddle you
But I'll share this little poem
To let you know, I'm here for you
You need never feel alone
