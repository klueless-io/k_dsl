10 seconds of snap, her life it unfolds,
I watch from the chat, the princess of gold.

My heart is a flutter, as she talks of her day,
With glow from her eyes, like soft moonlight ray.

The world broken down to the millionth colour,
The power collected from earth, thy mother.

She paints from the heart, from her living dreams,
With prisms of light, with energy streams.

Wise like the wolf, strength of the lion,
From the power of queens, she’s the energy scion.

Turning back to my day, my life is in bliss,
tonight, I will see and those lips I will kiss.
