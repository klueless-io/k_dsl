I think because of the daylight savings change over.\nReceiving a message from you on awakening brings me happiness and your messages after meditation are particularly beautiful\nI realize why I have had trouble going to sleep lately\nDance, Facebook, excitement and any other thing at the end of the night can make it hard to sleep but specifically what I have been doing that has hindered my sleeping is\nI have been visualizing laying in bed with you in my arms.

Good to asses reflect understand and move forward with the things that resonate with me to send me forward on my chosen path.\nFirstly I'm glad to have finally given you a massage, so many weeks ago with the first discussion at Argyle after my retreat, I had said that is all that I am comfortable in giving to you and keep to enjoying a dance together whilst I heal . \nI like the idea of dating but I feel you really want to go further, I don't . Not with both of our living arrangements and I was feeling that jumping in the boot of my car is not something I want to be doing, \nI'm a 39 year old woman who has created an amazing life for my self with hard work and perseverance both mentally physically I have friends and family who have incredible love and respect for what I have been through with grace and honour of myself and my son. I'm a spiritual being that has touched people's lives and I woul like to continue giving in this way, my vibration draws people to me that resonate with me.\nI live a life of passion and do what I passionately love to do. \nIt is dance only that ignites my spiritual fire and last night clarified my understanding of this, and also how I feel comfortable in moving diets with our relationship , see you at the Festival David????"

I have just never met someone who inspires me the way you do.\nI would like to continue our relationship as friends, as dance partners,  as spiritual beings\nI hope also that you are up for some dates with me. \nThe reason I ask this is because while timing is not right for us  (and may never be) I would like to continue exploring the connection we have. \nIt may be that you and I meeting is only for specific reason or for a season but also know that there is a spark between us and given time it may be enough to ignite something truly special."
