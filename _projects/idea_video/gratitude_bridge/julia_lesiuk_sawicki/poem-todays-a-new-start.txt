Breath so soft, I kiss her lips
A tear in her eye, i kiss her cheek, 

Tonight fear is alive, so I sit and I hear
With strength to share, i sooth her tears

While turmoil is hers, i can be the rock
Her safe place to cry, to let go of the shock

With naked chest pressed, I share love in my heart
And as her pain starts to die, I say today's a new start
