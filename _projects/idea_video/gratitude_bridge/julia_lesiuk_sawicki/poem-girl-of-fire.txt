Halo cloaks the shadowed form,
Red of fire, from energy torn.

Sleeping girl who's latent power,
Will rise in strength, but in the hour.

But now she dreams in spirit force,
She rides the path on noble horse.

Forty sisters, from years just past,
Protect her flanks, their wisdom vast.

Her life at juncture, no future set,
The sisters past, a great asset.

But now she strikes, the path unknown,
Enchanted seer, with hallowed thrown.

Her kin and tribe, a stable hub,
And at the center, her precious cub.

Her life worth living, so full of zest,
in her heart, she knows she's blessed.

But in a future, as yet unfurled,
Who could there be, to complete her world.

A man of strength, with power and passion,
and tenderness, love and compassion.

Who is this prince, of gold sunlight,
Who'd stand her side, both day and night

Would he hold her hand, partner in life,
Could he ride with her and fend of strife,

Before the answer, the vision clouds,
The foggy view, his face a shroud,

With light of dawn, she fades from dream,
A new vision met, her heart a gleam.

Blue eyes watch, as she slowly wakes,
Splashed with love, that would never forsake.

Her eyes start to well, a warm loving tear,
He holds her close, says, good morning my dear.
