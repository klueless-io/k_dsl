Tonight I danced the elements five
And there I danced my angel alive

As i moved my feat while the  music pumped
From the earth I felt her heartbeat thump

A wind arose, blowing skirt of lace
And there she stood, what beauty, what grace?

From my loins arose a fire that flared
To entwine this girl, to feel us paired.

She offered a cup of water sublime,
She kissed my lips, this goddess devine.

Said the radiant spirit, let our hearts merge together. 
I looked in her eyes, said I'll love you forever.
