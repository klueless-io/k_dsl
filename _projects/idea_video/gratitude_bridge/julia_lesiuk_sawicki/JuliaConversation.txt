Thank you for the dances David , I had a really fun time and appreciate, your tips and counting me through it helped me a lot. Got home and couldn't sleep until 3 am, I was thinking through all the different dances from last night. Does this happen to you?

Your welcome Julia. I to still think about the dancing often while dreaming but not like when i first started. But I can relate to how you feel

David Cruwys
3/20, 2:59pm
David Cruwys
Cool. Just seek me out at the dance venue's and especially when its quiet i will just do some training runs with you
Just doing 1 or 2 songs with just training should be enough to advance you a fair bit
Then take to the social floor with different people for practice
My phone is about to run out of charge. If i don't reply that is why

Hi David thank you for the dances last night.  Sorry about talking about my divorce stuff, I promised myself not to do that, just felt a bit exhausted, I value our friendship and thank you for your help, you are a brilliant dancer and I trust your expertise and advise, I will learn the fundamental foundation first and then layer my own expression one that  is done otherwise my salsa dancing will get messy and wild like the man dancing with Wolves , have a great Easter love Julia
David Cruwys
3/24, 10:41am
David Cruwys
I think I too was tired when we chatted last night, I think too many late nights and I did not get to sleep until 1:30 and woke again at 2:30 so today is no better.
I also value your friendship, please don't worry about talking about your divorce stuff, I'm a good listener.
Have a good yoga retreat and when you get back, maybe we can spend a little bit of time just having some simple 15 minute practice sessions.
Take care Dave x

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/1, 5:02pm

David Cruwys
Good morning Julia, how are you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:16am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Hey I'm good, what type exercise did you decide to go with?
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:16am
David Cruwys
I have not fully decided, but for now I am leaning towards kung fu
I don't thinkg I'm strong enough for yoga yet
and I really want to take a longer term approach and increase my strenght over time
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:18am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
That's good, well Iv decided to do a course in drumming
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:18am
David Cruwys
learning the drums as an instrument or more about tribal drumming?
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:18am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Tribal
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:19am
David Cruwys
that would seem really good for you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:19am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I'm drawn towards a more earthier exspression
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:19am
David Cruwys
I can see that
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:20am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I went to the Anglican Church yesterday , big mistake !
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:20am
David Cruwys
hmmm, what was that for?
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:23am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Just loving the community vibe and they had separate activities for kids, the sermon was about divorce and how a woman cannot marry another man a Christian faith unless her husband has died
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:23am
David Cruwys
are you Anglican?
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:23am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I felt like shit after, no Catholic
I think I'll stick to my drum
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:24am
David Cruwys
here is my take on the sort of control that I see religion likes to sell
Relegion is for people who don't want to go to Hell.
Spirituality is for people who know what Hell is
Drumming is very spiritual
its all about heart with drumming
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:25am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yeah they break you down then offer courses and mentoring , it's just a business
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:25am
David Cruwys
I tend to agree
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:26am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yep and I think I'll learn to hear the tempo of salsa a lot better with it.
I'm planning to merge a bit of both
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:27am
David Cruwys
though personally while I'm not for religion, I don't have anything truly against them as I think there can be great messages from religious teaching, I just feel that as soon as some one is trying to dictate how I SHOULD live, they have already missed the most fundamental aspect of spirituality
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:28am
David Cruwys
thats a really good idea
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:28am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes I agree
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:28am
David Cruwys
I am thinking of merging my salsa in the direction of kizoomba
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:28am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Cool I need to see what that is like
David Cruwys
4/4, 9:28am
David Cruwys
I want to be able to have the fun of salsa with the personal connection of kizoomba
I have some music that you might like the feel off
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/4, 9:29am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I'm free Tuesday night anything happening salsa wise

It felt like he was just feeling my body movement lightly touching like in the workshop , my tourso and shoulders, he then understood my body's movement that's when I felt totally comfortable and I trusted him, he could done pretty much anything to me as he was gentle and he had a sense and understanding of my body before starting to do bigger moves, full on connection baby it was great

Good morning Julia, I hope you have a wonderful week
Here is a little poem that I found about dance
David Cruwys
4/11, 7:08am
David Cruwys
I am afraid of how this one might end
it's almost like my decisions might be my friend 
If I play my weary hand just right 
I might be happy for all my life 
Yet still there is uncertainty About what my future will be 
Will it be mine? Pure happiness?
Or will I never see her long white dress? 
Will I ever take her from the isle if I miss this chance? 
I think I couldn't I know I wouldn't. So I'll ask her Would you like to dance?

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Beautiful David, good morning and thank you for the poem, "That's what it's all about", Dance is a beautiful and so thing when over thought can stuff it up, when I get tired I start overthinking and my mind fills with crap and my dancing also becomes crappy , I'm going to try after last nights workshop to approach anyone regardless of there style and see if I'm able to let go, not worry about the steps and not over think but go with there flow, and listen to the music for a change , have a great week ??

Would love to hear more about your insight, for myself I find that every morning upon awaking my thoughts are drawn to you Julia,  for whatever reason I find myself dwelling and considering you and I feel my vibration rising. I'm not why this but its as if you operate on a frequency that is congruent with me. Sorry if that sounds weird.

I’m sending you this text first thing in the morning, not to say good morning but to make you smile the second you see this.
Have a wonderful day with your kids, your art and your rehearsals. 
I want to let you know that I woke with these perfect photos in my mind. 
One was looking upwardly with you standing on last nights park bench, the full moon casting you in a warm glow. 
Another was holding you in my arms and drawing in all the delicate features of your pretty face.
The last was just walking hand in hand with you.
These were were the memories that brought a smile to my face upon awakening. 
Have a lovely day Julia xo
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

Going with the flow and following my intuition is key, I'm choosing to follow a spiritual path David and I'm inviting you into my sacred space as I trust you will honour this, I have noticed that you are very good in tactics, and mindful of everyone's feelings, as I have Experienced  with my past relationship everyone has a dark side I have seen my dark side and I know what I am capable of an so have you, I can see glimmers of it on a occasions , I understand I am healing I am choosing the light?????? with love no fear, and following my intuition my body and intuition is telling me to be close to you at this moment in my life. Don't control me or override me following my spiritual path as this will be of no service and our journey together will end. That what I got from my meditation David Have a beautiful day. ?? no fear, like the slogan on your t shirt you wore last night.
David Cruwys
4/20, 7:41am
David Cruwys
I love the insight you seem to achieve through your daily meditations and feel blessed that you invite me into your sacred space (no matter how limited that may be right now).
I think of you as being part of my inner circle, and now part of my intimate circle, I look forward to sharing more of myself with you and coming to know you Julia.
I too have a dark side. I have been sending love too to it for some time now but I have a certain amount of healthy fear around my dark side as well, I say this not to frighten you, but more to let you know that I have my own demons that I'm gradually taming and in some ways learning that much of my strength comes from them.
"Don't control me or override me following my spiritual path as this will be of no service and our journey together will end", I hear you Julia
I'm grateful to have spent some time in the sunlight of your spirit. Have a lovely day Julia xo

David Cruwys
Good morning tiny dancer. 
I was thinking about last nights message from you being melancholy. 
I know you have traumas, I feel your sadness when a little girl comes to your class with a bruise on her eye, I've noticed your anger over the thought of men trying to control you. 
I tend to believe that "you GROW through what GO through" 
I think you have a rare and wonderful array of qualities. I see your strength and resilience, I love your femininity and playfulness, I feel your compassion and worry and I'm inspired by your purpose, your drive, your why.
Have a wonderful day Julia xo
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/21, 7:03am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Good morning David, one question for you , what is your definition of "dating"?
David Cruwys
4/21, 7:03am
David Cruwys
Good morning Julia
Interesting of question, I don't think I have a fixed definition, I guess in the past it has been going out on dates (doing things with different someone, a movie, picnic, dinner etc..)
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/21, 7:07am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Hmmm 
I have never done it, and I think I would like to try this until I'm legitimately single.
David Cruwys
4/21, 7:08am
David Cruwys
is that something you want to try with different people? or is that something you want to try with me?
I have no worries around your response, please speak without fear
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/21, 7:21am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes I think I'll try this concept with different people and you if you want to invite me on a date. as I feel this may have been my down fall in previous relationships I give so openly and trust so soon my soul, spirt heart. 
I need to get to know someone by dating first before I can go further, as for my tummy thing I need to learn to just deal with that in my own way and be strong about it. I am a passionate woman and have a huge amount of energy, my lesson now is to learn to control that. To learn to disperse this energy to different groups and all of it to one,
David Cruwys
4/21, 7:22am
David Cruwys
I would love to take you on a date (or a few ;)
I understand that you also need to explore who you are with others
I would not want to change that about you
but you need to know, I will fight for you as well
well at the moment, I still don't know you enough
but what I do know is amazing
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/21, 7:27am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I am so happy, thank you David, dating seems like a good thing for me now, as I think anything else will be destructive and messy ??
David Cruwys
4/21, 7:28am
David Cruwys
Yeah, I understand, can I let you know that I too am passionate
I say that because I also go deeply into relationships and often to fast for my own good
its interesting sending messages to you because on one hand I want to develop something special with you and on the other hand I don't want to loose myself in the process
I know that I'm a hopeless romantic and that's not always a good thing
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/21, 7:31am

Gotta go David and stick my hands in some clay, have a great day ??

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
4/22, 6:27am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Im sorry I woke you, I'll send this message in a Few hrs so you can sleep just writing after my meditation and realise that last night I had took on my friends fearful energy from me, light she had haunted my spirit for you, making me doubtful , just shows the power and influence of negative energy.
Kana has a lot of experience with this negativity from others  in the work she does ,as an intuitive worker she meditates a few times a day, especially after some meeting and described to me that she sometimes literally had to spew the negativity out of her body, to then be able to tap in  clearly again. 
I also had dinner with Peter and Sebastian last night for the first time, wonderful to see Sebastian but Peter did his usual control shit by arriving half an hr later than the agreed time and as he had changed the locks on the door I had to wait outside, anyway I will ask Karan about her meditation in purging negativity from others. 
I hope you rest well boil some fresh ginger in water and a little honey to help with you chest I'll also give you a reiki helping and massage. When we have the right space to do it in xo??

David Cruwys
4/22, 7:41am
David Cruwys
I would love to chat wirh you about your message above.  Next time we are hanging out bring into the conversation this idea of taking on someone else's negative energy
FYI your message did not wake me. I think my phone is silent at night. I just did my natural wake-up which is usually 5.53 but of late has been happening around 5. I think because of the daylight savings change over.
Receiving a message from you on awakening brings me happiness and your messages after meditation are particularly beautiful
I realize why I have had trouble going to sleep lately
Dance, Facebook, excitement and any other thing at the end of the night can make it hard to sleep but specifically what I have been doing that has hindered my sleeping is
I have been visualizing laying in bed with you in my arms. Sometimes your back to me sometimes your facing me
I've been kissing you and touching and caressing you and before I know it I'm wide awake
I don't know why you do this to me but I am really happy around you Julia

Do they. I have a place near you where i would normally get flowers because the roses are organic and full of fragrance but this was a rush job. Those roses a re commercial and so while they look pretty .i had to pair them with  the lillies so that there would be a fragrance
You are worth the best

Morning David just completed my practice meditation, it was a learning experience for me, first times as well in areas. Good to asses reflect understand and move forward with the things that resonate with me to send me forward on my chosen path. 
Firstly I'm glad to have finally given you a massage, so many weeks ago with the first discussion at Argyle after my retreat, I had said that is all that I am comfortable in giving to you and keep to enjoying a dance together whilst I heal . 
I like the idea of dating but I feel you really want to go further, I don't . Not with both of our living arrangements and I was feeling that jumping in the boot of my car is not something I want to be doing, 
I'm a 39 year old woman who has created an amazing life for my self with hard work and perseverance both mentally physically I have friends and family who have incredible love and respect for what I have been through with grace and honour of myself and my son. I'm a spiritual being that has touched people's lives and I woul like to continue giving in this way, my vibration draws people to me that resonate with me.
I live a life of passion and do what I passionately love to do. 
It is dance only that ignites my spiritual fire and last night clarified my understanding of this, and also how I feel comfortable in moving diets with our relationship , see you at the Festival David????
David Cruwys
4/23, 6:30am
David Cruwys
Good morning Julia, glad you had a great night at moon dance.
You are right in your assessment of how things are. On one hand, I do want more than what you want to give right now and on the other hand neither of us in a place to even do that effectively. 
I honor your truth that are in a healing and transition stage of your life. 
The reality is that I am too and I should continue working on my foundation. I have just never met someone who inspires me the way you do.
I would like to continue our relationship as friends, as dance partners,  as spiritual beings
I hope also that you are up for some dates with me. 
The reason I ask this is because while timing is not right for us  (and may never be) I would like to continue exploring the connection we have. 
It may be that you and I meeting is only for specific reason or for a season but also know that there is a spark between us and given time it may be enough to ignite something truly special.

Dear Diary, day 21 and I find Julia to be a simply wonderful, I wonder how long this will go on for, no one can be this perfect ,  I wonder when i will see the dark side of her,  what could she be hiding.  Maybe she loves the Kardasians ... Secretly sends money to the Donald Trump campaign ... maybe she has never seen star wars episode IV ... well diary i sleep another day grateful for knowing Julia.

Hey David I Woke up crying this morning lots of stuff boiling up in me at the moment.
I have a better understanding of the stresses and pressure Kristina is under as well as Anthony  and the kids, 
When one member of a family unit is affected by health issues it rips it affect everyone and more so the people surrounding the person in trauma .
This made me think about my parents they have been really struggling during my separation in a way they have taken on the brunt of my greaving, I need to look after my home life and focus on repair,
The purpose of social dancing was to add a light fun layer to my life , I had communicated to you not to kiss me, I feel our relationship is getting to heavy and I'm feeling the weight on top of all the other weight in my life that I'm having to deal with, it saddens me that I may have to stop dancing with you because of the arousing and captivating effect that seduces  me into reciprocating your kisses.
In a perfect world I wish I could go out and social dance after a full on day of work and have a few dances to relax and have down time , it would be nice if it was with you it would of been cool if we could of practiced some show off dance moves for fun that we learnt at the Bachata Feastival. But I feel you want more from me and I can't give you more I want to keep things light in my social domain I cannot handle anymore, I want to be free to go out with new friends I have made I don't want to start resenting you because your not giving me that freedom.

I usually have one or two words to say to you before you go to bed but im running late tonight and i think you are likely asleep by now.
I just wanted to say good night and also to reply to your message this morning
David Cruwys

David Cruwys
Julia,  thank you for being forthright with me, I know you have been saying your truth for some time and I guess I get lost in my own selfish desires and emotions and forget just where you are at.
There is one big mistake that I have made and that is to kiss you on the dance floor.  
I say this because the dance floor is a sacred place for people like you and I, it should be a place where dancers can let go, connect and sink into the rhythm of each other. In its purist we start to flow, become alive and for me it is the one place where I truly connect with my spiritual self.
In kissing you on the floor I start to rob that experience from both of us and I'm sorry for doing that.
I know for myself that I am not ready to meet someone.  As you know because I have been quite transparent (maybe a little too honest) about my own challenges and struggle. My own focus still needs to be on getting my own house in order.
Hearing that you woke up crying, I begin to understand the trauma you are going through and also how it affects the other people in your life such your parents and Sebastian.
I think you know that I care deeply for you and that isn't changing anytime soon I think, but i also know you need nothing more then a light and easy friendship.  
If you were my dance companion and friend then i would be truly blessed.

Thank you so much David, you have no idea how this has put my mind at ease about you, I am so excited now about our future journeys together dancing , it is like the weight on my mind and spirit has been lifted, making me feel boyant and light again, I had visions of you in my future journeys and it gave me great sadness to see this as possible changing. Thank you ???? p.s I'm off line for a couple of hrs so pleas do not disturb.??

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Good morning David, thank you for the lift last night, 
From my meditation this morning, Stella and you have an amazing gift of service to our community, through dance you are presenting a way of healing for individuals that have been broken down in relationships helping them to make that step forward into a better space, your work is important to help people and I would love for you and Stella to be my mentor in dance as one day I would like to be at a level of dance to also do this for people as a volunteer community service by simply giving one beautiful dance to someone that has never experienced before, it is life change, 
Stella and you and hopefully eventually me, we are changing lives with our volunteer community services. My sister does this in Auckland as well.
I was watching Stella and you patiently at work with the newbies on the dance floor and it was truly inspiring, a service volunteered service that should be added to your LinkedIn profile ha,ha
You were a gift to me from the universe when I danced with you for the first time at the Orient, it lit a spark in me and ignited my passion again for free life. I will always honour you for for helping me, David, that will never be erased fin my mind or messenger, ha ha
In reflection to last nights conversation and what you had spoken to the councillor about, I am sorry sending mixed messages, I was feeling week and vulnerable , I needed to be held as my mum and John are still sick i could not go to them, they also informed me of there financial issues having lost a lot of money in shares recently. 
It is vital that I grow my business as I need to generate work for both Mum and I as soon as possible , my step dad has been trying to get work but with no success
I have nothing else but dance in common with you and so that is why I don't think our relationship should go into anything else as this would destroy what we have now and  the future of working as a team to give our God given services to help people ignite there passion and change there lives to create a better community a better world to live in one dance step at a time??????

Good morning Julia, I hope you are having beautiful day with Sebastian down at Shelly Beach, I was touched by the first half of your message and so grateful that you could see that aspect of me because I was little blind to it and especially last night. I often ask myself what more can I do in the service of my community and currently it is only around helping suffering alcoholics and once a month I do H&I (hospitals and institutions), currently I have been going to a low bottom psych unit to talk for an hour and have constantly been questioning what more I could do and had already contacted a prison representative to talk to inmates about alcoholism but I have not followed through and also thinking iff doing Soup Kitcgen service in Friday nights but hace not followed through but through your message you point out benefits of just taking a new person for a dance and giving over my ego and just having a connected dance with that person can be really healing and i can be of service in a way that is congruent with who I really am. Last night I was far from that place. I know that I was in a lot of self centered fear and when i was in the advanced class I was quite disconnected and irritated because I almost every girl was not at a level that I wanted. I don't know where you saw my service but last night. Your words "I was watching you and Stella patiently at work with the newbies" but I felt far from that place and I know that I do receive a lot of internal happiness when I am at service in that community
David Cruwys
5/1, 11:33am
David Cruwys
I  am very grateful for you saying what you did because I now have some clarity around what I can do to fill the contribution aspect of my life without worrying if i am doing enough or feeling like what i am doing is out of alignment with who i am
For the other part of your message I hear you
I am going to spend sone time today in natural environment and just think and ask questions from my higher power
But i was wondering if you would be ok catching up tonight to talk after you have put Sebastian to bed. I can come over to you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

David Cruwys||heart
The Dancer and the Artist<br />
Her body the brush;<br />
The floor, the canvas;<br />
The music, our heartbeat;<br />
Rhythm, Tempo, splashes of colour;<br />
Looking into her eyes, he embraces her<br />
The heartbeat is slow; they sway like leaves in morning air<br />
The brush moves, slow and measured, there is a build-up of earthy colours<br />
Soon the heartbeat increases, the brush glides across the canvas.<br />
He whips the brush in circular motion; blues, brightly spiral the canvas.<br />
The heartbeat erupts, he dips the brush, orange splashes outward.<br />
Colour lights up the canvas, as the brush moves to its own rhythm<br />
Soon the heartbeat begins to slow, back in embrace he cradles the brush<br />

Yes and more bookings coming in today, connected with Simons this morning insane stuff happening, I'm opening my heart and receiving the gifts from the universe , give your trust to the universe trust your inner voice during meditation believe that people connect and cross your path for the time that is necessary for the greater good of community , everyone should be free to move with respect and grace to share there knowledge to the people in need of ther offerings when this is denied the dark side comes forth to protect the spiritual whilst she finds her path again??

My heart is brimming with sorrow I need to do a practice now I collapsed into bed at 8pm exhausted from having to sit with my ex whist he ate dinner with Sebastian I wanted to scream at him and ask him why ? Of all the hurtful things I just woke up now to the sound of my son sobbing in his sleep I feel it's my fault I feel weak I'm going to do a practice with tears in my eyes and I hope I find some peace with my meditation, tonight's not a good night, my pain is bubbling up , fuck it hurts

Feeling better now more in tune. I was feeling guilty that my son was crying. I thought it was my fault and felt his pain my pain, being with Peter tonight and with Sebastian was tough I had so much anger as it could of been a beautiful life  for us, sadness fills my heart. I was looking at Peter and thinking how handsome how smart how much I loved him. I know why he was cruel to me as he was going through his own grief of losing a father and loosing a friend to alcoholism. I was not strong enough to take on his aggravated soul he started using me sexually disrespectfully to fill his void and broken hearts, as I had already seen this behaviour with Paul warning bells rang and I had to escape as I met Paul at A time when he had just divorced from the love of his life, and we played devious games together, but I can't do that anymore not as s mother to a son I adore . 
I need to be watchful of myself and listen to my spirit, if I need to cry I must cry , grieving is the touchstone to healing. Drumming, dancing, yoga, meditation helps me with that process, no sex I'm not ready as my sacred space still needs to heal.

I think I will, I spoke with my sponsor this morning (he is the wisest man I know and we had a chat about various things including dreaming and the idea that dreaming can be either toxic or tonic and we also talked about creative out expression for me (e.g drawing or something like that) and it got me thinking that the creative expression that I like doing that is good for my brain is poetry and so I now have an idea for a poem or maybe just a diatribe about dreaming.

I do hope we can have other dates between now and the 22nd anyway, or at the very least catchup for dance practice.
I'm wondering, do you want to make AcroYoga, a regular thing for a little while on mondays? (I understand if you need to at least wait until after Black Tie Ball), and also Tuesday Nights down at the retunda for dance  practice?

Each mornings when i get up  I pray to god to direct my thinking, i ask for fear to be removed, i set my intenentions for the day, and then i feed my subconscious with my future dreams. I'm not content to live a life without meaning, I'm striving to live an uncommon life and to live a life of purpose.  I see a kindred soul in you. Good morning Julia, have an uncommon day. xo

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Good Morning David, I don't agree, your not common nobody lives a common life we are all special and should be living our own lives following our own unique paths being touched by people that may cross our path, with meaningful communication and people need to be listened to. 
David my whole body pulses with energy I as I am connected but it took two years of work in making the shifts, 
I sent the Blog to Peter  from elephant journal thanking him for breaking my heart and how it had changed my life and giving me purpose to connect with people that respect me as I respect them listen to me as I listen to them and share each others wisdom of there journey with respect and honour, the children I teach, teach me a lot. 
I am learning to listen with respect and this is something that I had not done in the  past and had ruined my relationship with Peter, listening and respecting with no jugment vital . Good morning David.
And patience David!!!!

David Cruwys

David Cruwys
Hi Julia, I took some time to reflect on your message this morning, (well there are at least 3 messages in one). 
I want to expand on my communication from my awakening, as you may have missed some of my intention around living an uncommon life, I agree that we have unique paths and that the crossing of paths adds meaning to everyone, for instance your ability to reflect on peter, to even thank him for breaking your heart is very powerful, my own leaps in growth have come from most painful experience and I welcome the growth today from my challenges, hopefully I won’t have too many truly toxic challenges but if I do, I know I never need to regret those experience nor wish to close the door on them.
I’m no rockstar, neither famous nor a guru, I’m no business superstar, but then I don’t equate these stereotypical views of success as meaning that these people are living uncommon lives. 
When you say that everyone has unique paths, I would also add that everyone has own unique life changing gifts, but I’ve notice that most people don’t explore them, they don’t allow their gifts to blossom, everyone gets smashed in the face by life, and when this happens enough, most people give up on their dreams.
For me, living an uncommon life, is to continue to explore who I am, how I can contribute to planet, how I can be a positive influence to others, how I can take my talents and share them with the world and also find deeper meaning for myself in developing those gifts.
About 8 years ago, I wrote two different tag lines that have continued to resonate for me 
- “Personal growth at just 2% per month, leads to doubling your personal capacity every 3 years” 
- “The quality of my life is in direct proportion to my helpfulness”
I certainly have my ruts in life, depressions, slow times, but I know that I always come back to equilibrium and for me, that means to live life with Passion, to live life with Purpose.
Right now I am buzzing as I have just done another 40 “I am Statements”, I love that process.
>> “Good morning David. And patience David!!!!”
I am patient; I am patient with myself, my friends, with my son, with my higher powers plan for my life, and I am patient around you Julia.
I don’t need much to feel Joy, generally I manifest my happiness from within, but I will say that a simple dance under the stars with you; passionate kisses beneath a Moreton Bay Fig; or just holding you in my arms for five minutes on bench overlooking the harbour and I find a place of serenity that lasts for days.
I respect and honour the moments that I spend with you Julia.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/6, 9:46am

Thank you David, I want to continue experiencing beautiful moments with you, With a bit more attention I have been giving my Mum dad and son in the last couple of days, I cannot begin to explain the change of dynamics in the house hold
David Cruwys

Hi Julia,  not sure when you will get this message, not much reception which is probably a good thing.  
I like this place, vegetarian dinner was wonderful. And the people i meet are in a different head space to the city. Numerous conversations tonight with people are throwin words around like, God, spiritual practice,  reincarnation as if it is the norm.
We had orientation tonight an will start with Ji Gong class at 730 in the morning.
I have just gone out for a walk up the road. It is so black ouside away from the cottage lights and really peaceful and the sky is lit up with stars. There is also the smell of ash and smoke because of undergrowth burnouts over the last two days.
I had a a goid trip up the mountains and I would frequently smile after thinking back to kissing you on the chair near your home, it was also nice to meet your mum. I was wondering if giving her flowers was the right thing, but the smile on her face was answer enough. 
I hope the artists night of nights was goid for you both of you and would love hear about your night.
Have a wonderful weekend Julia xo

You make me laugh, i was thinking about yesterday just as we  walked away from your mum and you had this big bunch of flowers in hand and I suggested you leave them at your home and the (don't tell me what to do) Julia came out and with eye forward and fierce expression you said, "NO ... THERE MINE". 
Just like a little girl who won't share an ice cream.

Good morning Julia, 
I'm really happy that I can bring some happiness to you with really simple actions. 
I dont have the resources right now to do grand gestures so i just do little things that come from my heart.
You motivate me, you inspire me.
I don't know where we are heading but I am enjoying the journey at the moment. 
What I find most lovely is that this is all so easy, your easy to be around,  your easy to talk to, your easy to have fun with.
I am happy that I can play some small part in breaking down walls around your heart because that means you are healing and with that I see you opening up like flower in full bloom. You are so full of life and and energy and you seem to sparkle in the sunlight of the spirit. 
I'm also grateful because you allow me to be me, and that means i can express my feelings with creativity and expression, and I'm finding that you allow this without judgment, you are helping me to become alive, its hard to put into words just how much I cherish the gifts you have been giving me just through be your natural self (I'm tearing up just thinking about it).
Have a wonderful day Julia xo
I will let you know later today but I may need to cancel seeing you today and tomorrow.  I can feel a burn in the the back of my throat and may need to rest up and make some sort of cold concoction to prevent  a cold from coming on.
Good day xo

Who do they think they are, to go around believing in themselves, loving themselves, admiring themselves, using their talents, expounding their ideas, opinions and wisdom, spreading their goddamn-blinding-Light? 
Women who don't need approval from men to feel they are valid. Women who don't need to be kept by a man to feel they are safe. Women who don't need to be in a relationship just to feel worthy. 
These are women who really, truly love men. 
These are the women that hold the Real Keys to the spiritual progression of the Masculine. 
They are the Ones who will love men from a place of re-discovered Wholeness and Empowered Essence. 
This is what Men really want, and need, in order to be free, divinely-motivated, built-up, charged and ready for the New Era. 
These Women of Spirit NEED men, and adore men. But they are programmed to CHALLENGE men at their very existential core.

Good morning David, how are you feeling? Listen to your body, if it needs more time to recover allow it to. I sent you a lot of love. Love, I wonder why we live in a society that is so comfortable accepting of hate but feel suspicious and awkward with love. Loving my morning time by myself painting in the studio.

David Cruwys
5/11, 6:36am
David Cruwys
Im a lot better.  But I know it could flare up, can feel that much. I will go to work and come home if i feel like im regressing. 
My take on feeling suspicious of love is fear,  fear if being hurt, fear of going deep, fear of rejection. Taking past disappointments and  projecting onto present moments.
My other view if suspicion around love is self love or lack of it. I know that one if my biggest obsticles to living a full filling live is accepting and loving myself, I have an inner critic that is not my friend. 
I've been doing lots of work around self love but have a long way to go. 
I have found some renewed inspiration around exploring self love with reading various  transcodes articles about soul mates, twin souls, true love and seeing that to have some some really deep like that means really coming to love yourself.
I send love to you and your son and your parents on daily basis along with some other people dear to me but i sometimes forget to send live to myself.
David Cruwys
5/11, 6:38am

I really love that you turn the flowers and poetry and what I  do for you into these works of art. It's like you take a moment in time, ir even a feeling in time, and physically make it permanent.

You stop sending me messages, poetry I see a change in our communication, not sure if I like this. Kind of reminds me of all the other beginnings and whenever things become intimate the romance and courtship stops, that's a shame David.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 4:04am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I'll need to reflect on this during my meditation I don't want the same shit happening as it has before, that is my greatest fear. I'm striving to carve new a new path and avoiding the same old, I'm tempted to take sanctuary with my sisters whist I heal, I feel it may be a wiser path
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 4:06am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I'll reflect on this with my practice, ??
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:24am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
So angry David I could not finish my practice, spent most of my time in a head stand, this is where I felt most comfortable. I need to turn my life upside down for change. 
I feel a lot of rage coming up its not safe for me and it's not safe for you, I'm still healing your still healing.
I have always reached out to men, I love men I love challenging men physically, I don't want to be labelled at the moment by you, feminist Horney I'm not ready to take on those labels without it hurting me a great deal.  I don't want to do this with you David, during my time of healing I will turn for help from my women friends women around me I seem to take for granted and I feel it is time to honour them, each time I was kicked in the guts or hurt I would always run to them during my most desperate time   It ahouldnt be like this I should have them around me all the time especially during my healing,
I'm not don't like David that you communicate to so many people about me  it makes me Cring each time I hear you have spoken to somonecelse about me , because of this I cannot enter a sexual relationship with you I need my privacy during my healing I need to find solace with my strong sisters who will guid me as you do with your female friends I need my sacred space to heal I'm not strong enough emotionally, to take on labels and judgment by A partner again, good bye David I need to journey this out alone ????
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:26am
David Cruwys
I'm sorry I created some pain
I was writing poetry again for you last night butcwas to sick to finish
I did not mean to imply or hurt
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:28am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Just angry I want to ride my emotions and to feel free to do so without hurting anyone
I'm not stable I'm not at peace my therapist said Julia it's only been three months , you have done so well, what is the rush
I need to connect with a woman
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:32am
David Cruwys
ok, I sorry
This is what I was writing last night, its not close to finished, I know where it is going, but it is about you, the tiger and the wolf
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:32am
David Cruwys
Who is this seductress, the fierce warrior princess?	
The lovely temptress, who captures my interest.
Why! when I should be asleep,
Into my heart, you quietly creep.
Awake and in tune, my mind wanders this night, 
My desire to see her soon, this graceful hawk in full flight
I power of the wolf, with sharp intelligence and an appetite for freedom,
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:33am
David Cruwys
I'm sorry I changed the way we were communicating, I guess I have and that is premeture
I was not meaning to be rude or disrespectful
I guess I was happy awakening another aspect of you, but I forget that your no where near ready for that
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:38am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I know I look forward to a time when I'm more stable less reactive , it's been affecting my home life as well, I really need space and keep things light as I'm becoming clouded and irritated I'm only thinking about sex and nothing else it's driving me and everyone around me nuts
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:39am
David Cruwys
if you also need me to be quiet with other people, I can do that, I guess I talk to people like tian, jin and ana because they are who I bounce my emotions with
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:40am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I then get angry and frustrated I need my space I don't wing to hurt anyone I. My healing process my family especially
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:40am
David Cruwys
ok,
I won't respond, any more to this as I think you need to just do processing anyway, I'm sorry for my part
I will still write my poem about you today, I was ready yesterday about Shakespere and the idea of courting
I am very alive when I'm in the courting rituals with you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:41am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I need to bounce my emotions off people to and reconnects with those friends
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:41am
David Cruwys
I can feel that I shifted my focus
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:41am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
My girlfriends again
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:43am
David Cruwys
but I will come back to what I really enjoyed about you and I, just the intellectual communication, the exploration of feeling with things like sex coming into the picture
without
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:43am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I need to heal
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:43am
David Cruwys
I'm sending you my love Julia

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

Sex is all I see when I see you
Sorry David
David Cruwys
5/13, 5:45am
David Cruwys
Just Heal, your too valuable to be in this turmoil
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/13, 5:49am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I need to connect with  my women friends I need to keep clear I need time , big things such as finalising my divorce are coming and j need to be in a place of clarity and focus and strength with no worries or uncertainties
I want to face Peter look him in the eyes unwavering and sign off our past life together
This is massive for me and I found that when it comes to relationships it's between two people, I want to hold that strength as I sensed it straight away with Peter when he entered another relationship with someone else when he lied to me for the first time
My house and home is a sacred space I must honour this, I am angry at myself that i was going to break the rules that I had created for my own sexual gratification,
Bye David
David Cruwys
5/13, 6:01am
David Cruwys

Hi Julia, this was something I started last night, but was too tired to finish, I thought I would turn it into a picture frame for you, but I find my artistic skills are not really upto putting something together. but this poem is about you and I hope you like it

Who is this girl, the fierce little princess?	
This lovely pearl, who captures my interest.
Why is it, when I should be asleep?
Into my heart, you quietly creep.
Awake to a tune, my mind wanders the night, 
Will I see her soon, this graceful hawk in full flight?
In solitude she roams, for this warrior is on quest, 
My heart knows she’s alone, yet I know it’s … for the best.	
**
Protected by the wolf; she faces deepest fear.
A supernatural being, to guide the priestess seer.
For dark is the path, where temptation abounds.
She connects deep with self, to avoid dangerous hounds.
For the pack is her life; she gives her strength to their needs,
She must shield them from strife, and so silently grieves.
**
Guided by the tiger, royal lord of his domain,
Her vibration lifts higher; her strength she regains.
With sexual appetite coming into ascension, she looks out for a mate,
He says temper that sensation, it’s ok to wait. 
But these feelings are powerful, unpredictable and wild,
He says nurture those feelings, but also love your inner child
** 
It’s close to the dawn, the world starts to shine,
I whisper so softly; will you ever be mine?
Said a voice, in the gleams; she’s no prize for the taking.
Stay true to your dreams; said the sun on awaking.
Stay in the light, to your true self give love,
When the time is right, you’ll receive your true love.

David it was so nice to laugh with you and have fun again. I missed it so much, we don't function well without dancing.
Your poem.
I feel the need to carve into glass, metal, clay or wood, you inspire me, you turn me on so deeply, with Your raw honesty.
I have never met some one like you, you captivate me you have an intensity that I find overwhelming and can feel lost in, scared, but addicted to the passion  
You fill my mind for hours after we connect and I feel withdrawn and needing you close when you are gone for to long. Like tonight and every time I see you I get lost in the feel of your touch you give me goose bumps, you stir me from deep within. I will be gentle with you and mindful not to spew negative thoughts on messenger, I will journal write and chat to you about any issues face to face in the future and be mindful of your feelings, I'm sorry that I hurt you David especially with so much happening in your life. You trigger my heart with so many emotions. It gives me great joy to know that life will never be numb with you. 
Six years of being sober. Congratulations David I look forward to laughing with you again on the dance floor

Hi Julia, I've just walked along bondi beach and it is great to feel the sun and see people living life with a smile. 
I went to a meeting at Bondi Pavilion and I am struck by the laughter and merriment that people have in the face of tragedy. 
One guy shared about his solution around constant fear having killed a guy with a hammer when he was in early recovery about 30 years ago.  He had a powerful message of hope. 
But sometimes in the rooms you hear stories that go to another level and you never know if it is going to come out of the mouth of someone with 20 years or 20 day's. 
But today a guy called "big wave Dave" shared about a meeting that was on father's day and also happened to be his 5th birthday and how his 15 year daughter humbly came up to him in the meeting and gave a father's card. He read the card during his share and it was a touching message from daughter to father.
He then spoke about the high, the elation because he had never received any father's day gift before. 
He shared how later in the day he almost picked up a drink,  he wanted to celebrate. you see we drink to be numb, to be connected, to wash away loneliness, to feel good, to celebrate. We drink because it is a solution to all our feelings. 
But he did not drink on that day but 42 days later he was on holidays with his daughter in Bali. 
While they were there a bomb exploded and his daughter was in that crowd.
He wanted to drink but instead he reached out to the fellowship by phone and found some strength. 
He came home without his daughter, she followed 15 days later but in 6 pieces. 
Dave went to meetings and people held him and loved him and i got witness his grace and humility today on my sixth birthday in a meeting looking out on the ocean in a room full of tragedy, love and merriment. 
I'm most grateful indeed today and wanted to share my morning with you.

Wow some powerful stories, thank you for sharing your morning on your birthday, 
You had asked me last night about Peter and I said I had no issues and don't think about him, this is the truth but not the whole truth . 
I have been programmed from a young age to deal with horror or tragedy by putting into a box and dealing with it later, I express through my art my love making my dancing not so much through talking or writing, this is something g that I'm learning to do with you and loving this new form of expression, 
I was always scared of writing as I was diagnosed with dyslexia in primary school   And felt like an outcast as I didn't understand the method they were teaching us at school, 
I was fortunate to have help from an amazing phycologist who had a very alternate method of therapy that worked as my right side of the brain, the creative side is over active he tried balancing it out with meditation and particular exercises, I also suck at maths but I have an amazing ability of lateral thinking, intuition and the ability to observe and understand and do anything that needs to be made or designed, before I create sculpture for example I can see it like a cad image before I make it i also have an understanding of material and there limits.  This is the same with my drawing and paint, I can draw anything from memory . 
I will be going to Bondi beach a little earlier for the meeting to have a Walk would you like to join me ?
David Cruwys

Julia, i had a great night tonight. I'm glad we were able to connect for an hour beforehand. I really like you and me time. Just walking,  talking and kissing.

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

That sounds like a great idea. I can see how nourishing the circles can be

Things are all happening David intuitively nothing pushed in due course
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:34am

I think part of what made last night so great was the energy coming from the partacipants
It was so soft and gentle but with a purpose
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:36am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:36am

I was imagining a world that had millions of such groups
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:36am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes
Strong respectful and gentle
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:37am
David Cruwys
I was also liking the idea around promoting and giving rise to the feminine energy especially as a counterpart to masculine energy
Personally I have a big problem with feminism
I have seen the destructiveness and decisiveness if feminism
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:39am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
So do I if its disrespectful
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:39am
David Cruwys
And how it can lead to men becoming feminine and wonen becoming masculine
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:40am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
You don't like lesbians?
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:40am
David Cruwys
But i love this more yiguc form of feminine power
Yogic
The idea that it is a union
No problem with lesbians
I guess when we get a chance to sit and talk
I would like to share my perspective around feminism in its dark form
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:42am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes David I love a the masculine that can lead with respect to the feminine , watching my sister and Adrian and how they work together was beautiful and very inspiring, I want a connection like that.
But I also am a worker
Izabella doesn't work
On her own business
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:44am
David Cruwys
But in response about lesbians and women living in the masculine.  I have no problem with that if the woman is inherently masculine in nature  aka butch. What i really dislike is a feminine soul who pursues masculine power due to societal condition
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:44am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
She works for Adrian
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:45am
David Cruwys
Is that good or bad for her
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:45am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
So my relationship would be something different and something I need to work out the balance with,
She has never been able to finish anything by herself , she dropped out of two university courses and jumps in differ t directions she talks a lot connects slot but does not do a lot, unless directed by her love
A lot
She needs a guru to follow
That's how she's been brought up by her mum
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:51am
David Cruwys
Something to note though is that she connects  a lot abd one of the most valuable skills on earth is the connectir personality
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:51am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
My mum brought me up to hold my own power
I know

5/16, 8:51am

She has a special foundation skill that is a good starting point
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:51am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
That's her gift
We all have our own gifts
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:52am

As to the other issues.  She can learn then and nuture them if she comes to understand that it is important
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:53am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I would love to have a partner that will balance me
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:53am
David Cruwys
I have some connector skill.  But it is totally a learned skill.  It only got to where it is because of training
I was your typical anti social intravert geek
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:54am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I know I love that as this is my weakness and you are teaching me this to
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:54am
David Cruwys
I'm still an intrevert. I find my energetic strength is solitude
But i can move outside that circle when i need
I don't see a weekness in you as a connector
I see it very strong
But maybe you need to use it with both focus abd purpose
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/16, 8:56am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Maybe more physical than verbal
David Cruwys
5/16, 8:57am

I was thinking that while you and I have limited time to connect and that when we do it is either in fun activity or kissing. 
I would like to see our connection develop in other other areas. E.g. business accountability partners. I know I can help you there and support/push if needed and I know you can definitely help me there as well.
But not involved in your business. I'm not looking to entwine. 
I just think that you and I spending some of our time together working on business  (vs in business) may be quite empowering for us individually and maybe for some future path if our relationship develops.
You want many things in a partner,  i know.  But one of them is someone who will challenge you to grow and that is what I want and you certainly do that for me.
I  would like to see that develop into something that is more union like rather than the current form which is kind off inspiring but individual. 
Ie you inspire me to be more.  But I know that i could be a hundred times more with the right person.  
Just want to explore some of those ideas with you

Good morning Julia,
 I just wrote this poem on the 380 bus.
I hope your sleep was restful and your dreams were light.
I wished a guardian angel to look over you last night.
As I ride in this bus, I see the sunrise on fire.
I'm thinking of you princess,  the beautiful woman I admire. 
As I travel through the five ways, I feel blessed in these happy days.
And as I arrive at the quay, to take the early morning scene
My heart is open to your key, for to me, your a queen

I was a bit reckless last night with my body, I do that on occasions, due to exhaustion or stress of the day I physically vent and this morning I was in pain,could not move. 
Until your poem pinged in this morning and snapped me out of feeling sorry for my wrecked body and initiate my self care process.
Still in a bit of pain my son is also home sick again and I have two classes to run and juggle someone to care for him whilst I teach as mums working , I'm going to lay low and self care when I can for the next few days  David my body is screaming for it.
Have a wonderful day  ????????

Good, look after yourself Julia
I spent some time down at the harbour doing Oms

I guess on reflection
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 6:03pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes good thinking
David Cruwys
5/18, 6:03pm
David Cruwys
You can have any client you want. Aim for someone you love working with
You should put some effort into the perfect avatar
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 6:04pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
?
David Cruwys
5/18, 6:04pm
David Cruwys
Its the type of client that you want to work with
Then your marketing is based around that concept
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 6:04pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes
David Cruwys
5/18, 6:04pm
David Cruwys
Rather then spray and pray marketing

5/18, 6:05pm

Hey I thought that poem was for me David
Hmmm
Bad choice
Nothing's sacred obviously
David Cruwys
5/18, 8:18pm
David Cruwys
What the dance poem
It is. I was talking to my sister Ana about you
And the poem i had written for you
David Cruwys
5/18, 8:39pm
David Cruwys
I was just talking to her about the magic you bring into my life.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 8:59pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Your poem seems a bit diluted David and thin when your words are spread around so much.
David Cruwys
5/18, 9:01pm
David Cruwys
?
Are you angry that I would  talk about you to Ana?
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 9:02pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
You talk to much to everyone
I don't like it
You post the poem that I thought you wrote for me on Facebook with comments of people getting boners over it, for fuck sake you know nothing of value or holding something in a sacred space.
Mum was right
As alway
David Cruwys
5/18, 9:11pm
David Cruwys
I did post that poem on Facebook a few weeks ago. I am definitely daft to some things and im sorry that hurt you.
The guy who wrote that comment is always inappropriate.
As to to Ana, I called her for her birthday which was yesterday and I spoke about you, thats the sought of relationship I have with her. I'm know your angry with me, I  was not aware of any mistakes I had made.
Im sorry
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 9:15pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Well you defiantly now how to open those boxes
David Cruwys
5/18, 9:15pm
David Cruwys
You mean boxes that hurt you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/18, 9:22pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I have to get. Back to work
David Cruwys
5/18, 9:43pm
David Cruwys
Dear Julia,
I really did not understand the harm I was causing you when I posted that poem, i remember on the day thinking that all I wanted to do was write that this poem is for Julia but I could not disclose that.
I know that when I wrote the second poem, I would not share it with anyone because it is deeply personal to me. 
Your's are the only eyes that have seen it, your's are the only ears that have heard it.
You see all I want to do is learn the song that is in your heart and if one day you forget it, I want to be there to sing it to you and remind you.
I have spoken a little to Ana about you and more to Tian. I can't imagine not talking to them about you as you bring magic and light to my soul.
I will not likely to sleep fir a while.  I know what I'm like, I will most likely fret about this all night.
There is one thing I believe to be true, never go to sleep angry at the other person.   
I'll be here and if you need to talk or vent or tell me off then do so.
Once again I am honestly sorry to have hurt you. 
David xo

Thank you for understanding that yesterday
Letting me understand that yesterday
During my Om practice tears welled in my eyes
I can't expose myself to you
David Cruwys
5/19, 7:01am
David Cruwys
Just be gentle on yourself Julia, I'm here if you need, but I will be distant if you need space
I will just send my love your way
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 7:02am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I need some one that can gently pull at the string to open my boxes of sorrow and gently unwrap each broken package so that I can take my time to put the peaces back together
David Cruwys
5/19, 7:05am
David Cruwys
I not sure if you're aware of it, but every time we have spoken or alluded to anything sexual, you have quickly become unhinged. I guess that is why I asked you if you are ready the other day. I don't think you are close to ready. 
This is the one area where I keep breaking my own promise around you and it is the one area where I fuck up with you.
David Cruwys
5/19, 7:06am
David Cruwys
I'm sorry about that
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 7:07am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Last night felt like a box knife had been used on the package that had contained my heart ?? I thought you were of service to me in helping to repair and put the peaces together , but you are not
I was alone last night and that is where I find my deepest strength
I am alone when I face my demons
I am alone when I face my fears
I get strength from my yoga
Meditation
Self care
I will now focus on my business as my creative outlet
David Cruwys
5/19, 7:10am
David Cruwys
I can resonate with what your saying, I have had to face my biggest demons on my own as well. It nearly killed me going through that, but it had to be on my own
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 7:10am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
My heart is to open for social dancing I feel to exposed
I don't want to become one of your poster girls on Facebook
Incognito
This weekend will be the last time I step on stage and perform
Through dance
I will now only perform with my art and yoga practice
There is a dirty side to dance that I'm not strong enough to handle, yet!!
I need to be surrounded by a gentler more holistic form of physical expression, during my time of grieving , I hope you understand this David ??
Reading back. You do, ??
David Cruwys
5/19, 7:19am

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
David I don't want to use you as a punching bag when I have emotional flair ups I don't want you to come any closer to me at this time it will only hurt you
David Cruwys
5/19, 8:51am
David Cruwys
Yeah
I'll just keep my distance,
Maybe in a some future time, we can look at things together
I'm just going to go back to working on my self
I love you deeply
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 8:53am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
That is a good idea , we stepped over the boundrys of kissing coming closer I will hurt you
I love you to David, my son I know loves me
He kicks me all the time to vent his sorrow
The phycologist explained this is a normal process the people you love will hurt you the most , you know that yourself David
David Cruwys
5/19, 8:55am
David Cruwys
Yes
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 8:56am

David Cruwys
5/19, 8:57am
David Cruwys
I assume you are talking about the dominatrix mentality
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 8:57am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yeah that guy rattled me a bit
David Cruwys
5/19, 8:57am
David Cruwys
That's not something that I am looking for
I respect you for that period of your life
I respect it because it shapes who you are
but
but its not what I want for me
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 8:58am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Good neither am I nothing good comes from it
David Cruwys
5/19, 8:59am
David Cruwys
The people I have had the most problems around in the last few years (Ana, My Son Steven, My Flatmate Sonia "you don't know her") have all nearly brought me undone, they have been people who I deeply love and care for, but I have almost destroyed my self on them
I don't want to destroy myself with you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

I don't want to destroy you David I never want to hurt you I am not disrespectful or abusive I keep respectfully to people's boundaries. Unless they request in a controlled and caring manner.
I understand what it is like to be hurt boundary's have been broken at the beginning of our relationship could this have been the case with all of those other horrible people that have hurt you in the past? Did you overstep some boundary's with your previous relationships?
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:37pm
David Cruwys
the answer to that is long and varied I guess
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:38pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
So complex you are
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:38pm
David Cruwys
I think part of the problem for you and I is that I met you 6 months to early
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:38pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Haha yes
I'm still in the chickens bum
The egg thing
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:39pm
David Cruwys
The big difference I find between you and past relationships, is that 
A. I am in a much better place with self (lots of self love and acceptance in me today)
B. I would not put up today (with what I found acceptable in the past)
C. You are (as you say, in the chickens bum)
I know that you are right for me
but you personally are not right for anyone right now
you need to work on you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:41pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
That's right I repeat I would like to keep it light , I think I have said this a few times
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:41pm
David Cruwys
yep
I think part of our problem is that we have such feelings for each other that keeping it light is nearly impossible
that's why I know I should have met you in 6 months
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:42pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
But we can't keep it light because there is something deeper connecting us
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:42pm
David Cruwys
yep
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:42pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
That's the fucked up thing
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:43pm
David Cruwys
I don't know what it is, I think it might be something like twin souls or soul mate
but as I have already read when looking into this
if personally you are not ready for your soul mate, then your should not even try to be with them
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
5/19, 1:44pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yes and I don't want to be thinking I have to be controlled by that connection
David Cruwys
5/19, 1:45pm
David Cruwys

David Cruwys
Good morning Julia,  
I woke around 430 this morning but really needed to rest and have been just lying here day dreaming. 
It's been relaxing to think about you.  Imagining you in your different yoga poses,  eyes closed,  serenity on your face as you sink into your meditation.
I've been sending love to you, and surrounding you with with light, warm yellow glowing balls of gentle heat to melt away your fears. 
This morning I have also massaged you from head to toe and breathed life into your tight muscles.
I've washed the souls of your feet, massaged them in such a way that spiritual energy flows through to every organ of your body, radiating health and vitality.
I have also put my lips to your feet and with every flick of my tongue or kiss of my lips I have sent kindness and compassion to the darkest areas of your body so that the physical walls that are blocking you will crumble and you can be free.
Your soul and mine have been intermingled and I've watched as they danced along the edges, undulating and entwining. Sometimes as one soul,  some times as lovers the lightest of touch only in the most sensitive of places.
When I touch your soul in this way I know true connection,  my body tingles,  my heart opens and I feel fully connected to god. 
Thank you Julia,  I am grateful this morning.

 Good morning Julia, 
I feel  a tad deflated right in this moment as i have spent a couple of hours in poetic meditation and was writing prose with words that were flowing through me but not from my limited intellect.
I was given such a gift this morning as I wrote to you and then as I hit send I somehow deleted it all.
Maybe this gift was only meant to be for me today.
I hope you have a lovely day. I think I will because I still have the memory of what I wrote in my heart. 
Goid day xo

Yoga and spirituality has been the key for my healing proses we connect spiritually on the dance floor and I would love to continue to explore a spiritual connection with or love making, my body is a juicy flow again and I haven't had that for two years , I dried up with Peter it was horrible.  I'm flowing with you it's beautiful. I feel calm and relaxed I slept deep and feel rested, centred, thank you for sharing that with me and letting me express the moment with you. David. I love, also remember to live in the now and not the past  I realise I'm able to do that now, I am trying create a practice that will help me surrender to the future and trust In God that I Dont need to worry so much, everything will be o.k. Good morning David . I love you????????

Hi Julia had a great meeting this morning,  the topic was on resentment, which is always a great topic for me to reflect on as it is the spiritual malady that has most ruled my thinking over my life. 
I  enjoy the opportunity to look at this aspect of self and my own delusions
The rest of today i will be helping  tian  move from McMahans point to Kirribilli.
I realized that we did not end talking about feminism, maybe next time. 
I hope class was good this morning.

I awoke in the mist, but where? I not say.
The air glistened and sparkled, alive this new day.
Beauty danced right above me,  movement fluid and gay
Her body flowed in the flight, like a stunning blue jay
The flesh naked and lush, a beautiful Monet
I long for her touch, sultry temptress, so risqué
To my loins would she touch? dear God I do pray
Heaving breasts let me cup, in my arms if you may
But as the mist starts to clear, my heart breaks in dismay
She fades from my sight, I cry out, oh please let her stay

Good morning Julia, 
My day yesterday was emotionally flat and I found it hard to live in the moment. I think mostly I was disconnected from gratitude. 
Today I am grateful. 
I am grateful to be sober.
I am grateful to have professional guidance for my financial challenges.
I am grateful to have a connection with my son.
I am grateful that my mum and dad are in my life.
I am grateful for good friends.
I am grateful for interesting and challenging work
I am grateful for the passion that has been ignited through poetry and verse
I am grateful for light and energy that I see all around me when I look outwards 
I am grateful for the strong roots I have created over last few years leading to my emotional stability.
I am grateful to see beauty in this world through the photographic eye
I am grateful for the synchronicites that led to a deep connection with Julia
I am grateful to see my world massively expand through this powerful woman
I am grateful for the heightened connection to God that I feel whenever I think of Julia
Julia, to me you are like a prism that obsorbs all the beautiful energy flowing in and splits that energy into a million colours that illuminate every facet of my life. 
Thank you

"The dragonfly  symbolizes change in relation to mental and emotional maturity and the understanding of the deeper meaning of life." - it all seems providential to me as I did not know about the meaning and yet the message feels congruent with where I  am at this year.

"We are approaching a period of time when relationships are ready to go through a major redesign. The current paradigm isn't working. People are unsatisfied in love; people don't know how to make relationships work. And, believe it or not, this isn't a bad thing. Because when systems break-down, that's when they change. I believe that's what's happening in the area of intimate partnership. The break-down is forcing us to move towards conscious love. So what exactly is a conscious relationship? It's a romantic relationship in which both partners feel committed to a sense of purpose, and that purpose is growth. Individual growth. Collective growth as a couple. Growth that makes the world a better place. As of now, most people get into relationships to satisfy their own personal needs. This might work for a few years, but eventually the relationship fails us, and we end up unsatisfied as a result. But when two people come together with the intention of growth, the relationship strives towards something much greater than gratification. The partnership becomes a journey of evolution, and the two individuals have an opportunity to expand more than they could alone. Deep satisfaction and long-term fulfillment arise as a result. So if you're someone who feels called to take your experience of romantic love to the next level, below are four qualities that characterize what being a conscious couple is all about. Welcome to the path of the conscious relationship. This is next-level love ... 1. The conscious couple is not attached to the outcome of the relationship - growth comes first. Not being attached to the outcome of the relationship does not mean you don't care what happens! It also doesn't mean that you don't have fantasies about how the relationship will turn out. What it means is: you're more committed to the experience of growth than you are to making the relationship work. The reality is, we're here to grow. Physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. When growth stops, we automatically feel like something's gone wrong. Because it has. Without growth, we aren't fulfilling our soul'spurpose. Unfortunately, relationships today tend to stifle growth more than enhance it. This is one of the main reasons we're failing at romantic love. We want our partners to act in a certain way, we repress ourselves to please others, and soon enough, we feel small, oppressed and puzzled about who we've become. This, inevitably, makes the relationship feel like a cage that we want to break out of. But the unfortunate truth is: we've caged ourselves. The conscious couple values growth more than anything else because they know this is the secret to keeping the relationship alive. Even though growth is scary (because it takes us into the unknown), the couple is willing to strive towards expansion, even at the risk of out-growing the relationship. Because of this, the relationship maintains a natural feeling of aliveness, and love between the couple does, too. 2. Each person in the relationship is committed to owning their s**t. Conscious couples know that we all have wounds from the past, and they understand that these wounds will inevitably be triggered, especially in a relationship. In other words, they expect to feel abandoned, trapped, rejected, overlooked and any other shitty feeling that arises when we bond closely with another person. Most of us still believe that relationships should only feel good, and when bad feelings surface, something has gone terribly wrong. What we fail to see in this situation is that these shitty feelings stem from our own faulty patterning! These issues are not caused by our partners; they're caused by our beliefs. The conscious couple is willing to look at their past and current issues in relationships because they know that by facing these beliefs systems, they can evolve into a new relationship-reality. Dysfunctional patterns will dissolve, but only when we take responsibility for them, first. 3. All feelings are welcome and no internal process is condemned. In a conscious relationship, there's room to feel anything. Not only that, there's room to express those feelings and fantasies to your partner. This is edgy territory; it's not easy to do. But it's also one of the most healing things we can experience in a partnership. It's rare to be completely honest about who you are, and to stretch yourself to let your partner do the same. You may not like what you hear; in fact, it may trigger the hell out of you. But you're willing to be triggered if it means your partner can be authentic. Like I already said, we're used to moulding and changing ourselves to please people we love because we don't want them to stop loving us! This stifles the love out of our connections. The only option is radical honesty: revealing parts of ourselves that are hard to share, and letting our partners do the same. This leads to feelings known, seen and truly understood; a combination that will automatically enhance your love. 4. The relationship is a place to practice love. Love, ultimately, is a practice. A practice of acceptance, being present, forgiveness, and stretching your heart into vulnerable territories. Sometimes we treat love like it's a destination. We want that peak feeling all the time, and when it's not there, we're not satisfied with what the relationship has become. In my mind, this is missing the whole point of love. Love is a journey and an exploration. It's showing up for all varied nuances of your relationship and asking yourself, what would love do here? The answer will be different every time, and because of this, you'll get to grow in ways you never have before! The conscious couple is fiercely committed to being the embodiment of love. And through their devotion and practice, love shows up in their lives and relationship in ways they would've never imagined before." ~Shelly Bullard

How was your meditation and sleep? 
I had a hiccup thus morning.  Mum called at 230am but i did not see call till 330 and when i called she was a little distressed with sickness.  I called ambulance and she is at hospital now and in a bit better mood.
Im at airport now just organizing my accommodation and will then book flight back.
Plan is to meet Steven in the city and I think yumcha will be on the menu today.

Good morning David, wow you must be tired, have a great trip David I sent lots of love to you and Steve,
My body's feeling a little off balance I ate to much of my yummy pork belly last night and it has affected my yoga practice and also didn't get any visions, I'll need to be mindful of minimising my meat especially at night. 
I have a big day Photoshopping and posting on website then I need to go west to my clay supplier and then meeting with Peter for our last council. Before we sign off next month, I may go to tropical sol for my own therapy.
Getting all my financials done next week and the the following weekend I'm heading out of town, I need a break as I need a refill. 
Safe travel, love you loads and will send love to you both.

Your little body is not really designed for pork belly ??
I hope you and Peter have a beneficial coucelling session.
Enjoy your dance therepy tonight if you make it
I plan to call my sponsor when I land and discuss making step 9 amends with Steven
Step 9 : "Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others"
I'm looking forward to seeing Steven, I think it should be a really goid weekend for us
Thank you for your prompting message yesterday
Love you sweetheart and wish you a beautiful day xo

Hi Julia,
It’s been a pretty good day today, mum got out of hospital this afternoon, they have given her fluids and antibiotics, but said she can head home.
Steven was very happy to see me, which was nice, he mentioned this a few times today. We had a good day. Walked around a lot and spoke, had lunch went to the Pub, played pool in 8 ball hall, His Nana (on mums side) who he did see last week, but had not actually seen in 3 years also drove down today to give him is phone charger that he had left behind, so Steven, his nana and her partner and I had dinner together tonight. He has gone home now, he has to get up early to work all day tomorrow, I will catch up again on Sunday morning and then he heads off to go to work on Sunday evening.
I’ve just booked a flight back and will arrive in Sydney at 4:30 pm on Sunday.
I’m going to go to an AA meeting and then a Salsa Dance tonight.
I’m very grateful for this weekend.
How was your day Julia?

David I would like to thank you for helping understand my strengths. It has helped me heal.
I can look in the mirror each morning and see myself as a strong woman .
Peter was so toxic to me and had filled me with self doubt, as I am my worst critic  I know what j do wrong I just need love from you David and you say you don't need anything from me, well I'm willing to love you David for who you are I'm willing to share intimate moments with you,
you make my body tingle my my tummy stir.
I understand now because of our living circumstances Tantric love making and spiritual connection is what we are meant to explore with each others spirituality in dance and love making, I'm excited to do this with you David , I now understand what we are together , we will heal each other. And honour each other and become better people together .
 I value you David I honour you David, I love you David.
 Have a wonderful day ??????
David Cruwys
5/28, 7:55am
David Cruwys
How it is, that you can move me to tears.
I have been looking for someone like you all my life, I have always been a hopeless romantic and always thought that there was someone out there for me
But really I had also lost some  hope that I would ever meet this person
You seem to fit me like glove
I think now that I was never meant to meet someone like you until I was ready to start healing my self,  to take responsibility for my life
I really made some bad choices 6-7 years ago that have really contributed to Stevens current lifestyle
I was able to look at them a little with him yesterday and it gave me clarity around what I am really making amends for with Steven
You see. Making a Step 9 amends has nothing to do with saying sorry. The word Amend is rooted in the idea of mending
I either have to mend the damage i did to Steven or I have to mend my ways so I don't act the same way in future
You have been significant in my healing and I honour you for that Julia
David Cruwys
5/28, 8:22am
David Cruwys
But I have taken responsibility for my own healing first and I honor my self and accept my own self love there
I know we will become better people  (for ourselves) because of our connection as friends, as a couple and as lovers
I call you sweetheart, because it is the best word I know that conveys the purity that I see in your emense love,  weather that be for me, your son snd family or for yourself
Have a wonderful day sweetheart,   share your gift with your students this morning
Keep being the powerful, compassionate, fierce and loving lady that I see whenever I think of you

Are you ok
David Cruwys
5/28, 11:06pm
David Cruwys
which for him was a treat
mostly OK Julia
We talked about good things
but he also back slides into bad things
I can see this court stuff is really waying him down, but it is another issue that I really worry about for him
but, doing something like Korrean BBQ was great
he does not ever do that sort of stuff (well not since living with me)
so tomorrow, we will meet for 9am
do some things in the city, have another banquet of some sort (probabally yum cha)
he opens up a lot when we are just doing that sort of stuff
what was the best part of your night Julia

Good morning David , I slept a full 8 hrs deeply and I feel amazing , I had a slight sour throat but after my practice it seemed to of cleared, as yoga pushes and squeezes all my organs helping the crap that stagnates whist sleeping shift and clear.
This has been a week of mentle healing the monkey chatter in my head has gone for the first time in a long time. 
Over the past two years I've been scraping back my past canvas, a amateur painting of my life, caked on with everyone else's influences but non of my own choice of colours and composition the results of a student learning.
My blank canvas has its first layer of paint with the encouragements from the people who Give me true love and the people I now choose to surround me that serve me in allowing to be who I really am I am so grateful for them , David you are one of these people that has shown and held a mirror up to me so that I can see the confident woman I am and I am going to become something amazing because of that, I love you being apart of my life ??????

It seems like that is a poet living inside you
Your writing this morning has soul, it has depth. I can picture the old practice canvas. Its like walking into a high school art class where you have to use the brushes and paints that look like they are years old and never really cared for
I can also see this new canvas and how you are painting it with magic and layering down strokes of love and light
I read your writing and it ignites my own passion, I can wax lyrical in response to your writing
Have a goid morning

Good morning Julia, 
I hope you easy sleep last night,  i know that talking about Steven brought some negative energy into the space but I am thankful that you allowed me to share sime of what is going on with him.
All in all, I had a good and positive  time with him and that would not have happened without your suggestion to go there. 
Today I have a huge amount of work including getting some paperwork ready for accountant. 
I'm in a good focused position this morning. 
Good luck with all your bank work  today, hope your cold recedes as well. 
If you are well and we see each other tonight,  i will keep the energy light for you. 
Have a wonderful day Julia

Great, self care sounds just in order for you
I'm glad my little gifts are there for you
I am feeling a wistful at the moment
it has been some time since I kissed you and I long a little for holding you, looking into your beautiful eyes, and just gently kissing your cheek and your lips
I love the feeling of letting my lips press tightly around your top or bottom lip and just hold and suck on your lip, and let my tongue press against you
and I love to hold your in embrace while doing that and running my fingers through your hair
Get well sweetheart so I can spend time with you tomorrow night

Good morning little Goddess
Dancing was great last night,  i did level 4 & 5 which were challenging and fun and in level 3 I was a follow which is good for me
I've found this YouTube TV show that I have been finding a lot of inspiration from.  This is the link to this mornings video. https://youtu.be/OaF_sph4k7Y
I want to wake up every day energised and full of life and to immerse myself in the lightness of life, to be a fun person to be around,  to be an attractive soul to others. Someone that helps bring the best out of the people I'm around
I I I I I
I talk about 'I' a lot
The way the guy on the link above signs of is tha 'We' are all in this together
I'm going to be spending my morning on way to work sending my love,  my light and my energy to your heart
My body is already tingling just through the connection I feel with you Julia
Hope you are feeling  better this morning.
Love you princess xo

Thank you David, good morning.
I had a great night, soaking in a bath is something I need to do once a week to wind down, I have been so stressed, mum and I had a really good chat about the future of our business, The retreat, proposal that I'll send to Sanjay this week. Reki and Om is all I can manage this morning as my body is crying for physical rest and recovery, lying in the bath looking at my body I have noticed massive changes from 5 months ago, I love my body not in an ego way, with mindful eating and yoga it reflects the care I have given to it, I have shed my old self physically to a new body.

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
David I have honoured you as a dance partner with respect , I have had the upmost respect for you. I know now what a relationship with you will be like and in my personal circumstances I cannot continue down that path. 
I am bake peddling as or intimacy will always be on a public domain and it has not been honoured a couple of times., I love you I respect you I can only commit to you as a dance partner. To much is at stake in my personal life to go any further with you. I don't trust you in my sacred space, it has been published already to much I feel very  vaunrabl very exposed like I do in the parks with you. It's not what I want right now  
You are already juggling a lot of woman who are relying on your support focus your energy on them they have children think about what's going to be the best choices for those children and the mothers that care for them,
I have a little girl that I teach on a Tuesday nights I let her mum pick her up 20 minuets later then the rest of the student because she is a single mum with A four month old and and older sibling she has seperate do recently and is working having to take the baby to work with her, the whole family sleep in one bed , the little girl is so beautiful and her mum is trying so hard under the circumstances, I am happy to help her were I can. 
I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't feel comfortable I feel uneasy it doesn't feel right .
David Cruwys
6/1, 11:50am

I do still hope you will allow as to chat about this in person rather then just text,

Good morning David, I want to thank you for the care and nurturing you have given me in the past 3 months.
You have been a big part of helping me heal.
I will be going back over our written journey and transfer it into hard copy into my journal to remind me of our connection I will be deleting our digital record.
I am not ready as you we understand now for anything more than dancing with you David and yesterday clarified that for me, you are a dear and gentle friend that I will always have a soft spot for in my heart.
We have a lot of work to do in our lives and it is time now to get focused on the task at hand,
I look forward to connecting with you in the future on the dance floor a place that we know we can go to when we feel down to relax, enjoy and laugh. A wonderful part of my life that I always look forward to dancing with you??????

It's that case of always going somewhere in search for something and in actual fact everything that you need is at your doorstep.
Hi
Another observation your skin tone suits the landscape colours
Silver grey dark blue black
Even the sap green
David Cruwys
6/3, 10:00am
David Cruwys
During my mediation I was thinking about a marketing option for you to both keep you inspired, connected to your local community and bring in business.
You could do a series of videos around techniques for painting sunrises, put them on skill share.
Then you could do a free (or cost of material workshop for 30 minutes) every month down on the rotunda where you teach people to paint what they see.
Be a good way to bring in new target market people to ArtBox.
Especially mums with kids
David Cruwys
6/3, 10:03am
David Cruwys
its interesting that you saw that in the photo, the pinks in my face matches the sunrise and my poncho matches the ocean
I did not think about that
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/3, 10:05am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yep sounds good but I'm thinking of spreading my wings to regional areas getting sponsorship I will go to regional areas aboriginal communities and run workshops teaching how to use materials that they don't usually inspired by the local flora and fauna ebook and social media of my journey then Talbot workshops for of that exsprianse

Had some good one on one time with my friend Jackie, who is a psychologist. She challenged my thinking around a few of my challenges and that was good
One if the meetings yesterday got me thinking about how irrelevant the challenges in life really are. Every other month there is a challenge, every other year there is a big challenge that seems dramatic.
So long as I am living in the moment,  living in flow, living in gratitude.
So long as I am always trying to do the next right thing. Pray for guidance, sit in meditation.
I can keep my cool, no matter what storm is going around me
I think my day will finish here fairly early. 1 or 2 i think.  Then i will start driving back to Sydney
You have been on my mind a lot this weekend,
Its good to sit in the warm glow I feel when I think if you

"I'm not searching for my other half because I'm not a half"
Synergy is what happens when one plus one equals ten or a hundred or even a thousand! It's the profound result when two or more respectful human beings determine to go beyond their preconceived ideas to meet a great challenge.

Sitting on the Train, I reminisce this night.
Outside the sky pours rain, inside my heart takes flight 
For the girl with stunning smile, tonight we had our dance
For her I'd swim the nile, or take her on a sailing trip to France.
And and as I Glyde through Edgecliff station, recalling time with her tonight
I think she's God's gift to creation, a being of wonder, love and light.
As the Bondi Junction train pulls in, and I'm nearly to my door
I've walked the whole way with a grin, grateful for the angel I adore.

I know what the problem was with my scattered mind when I dropped you off at dancing. 
Your presence is so intoxicating.
Being around you sometimes feels like taking drugs, but not the man made ones. Instead it is the drug of oxitocin, the love drug that your body naturally releases. 
It feels great but some a little disorienting. 
Well I was happy to walk you to the door. Hope you have a great night dancing and say Hi to Ben and Gen

David Cruwys
6/8, 10:13pm

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/8, 10:13pm

David Cruwys
6/8, 10:20pm

I am happy that you responded to the picture I sent, but I know when you are busy and I send those things so that you can have a smile in the middle of your hectic morning, not to pull you away from task.
When I send a little joke to you (no matter how childish), it is also just to give you a smile in the midst of busynes
David Cruwys
6/9, 7:13am
David Cruwys
--------------------------------------------------------
In response to "that's for everyone" I say yes and no. Inside every one is a perfect being of love, strength and light. There is a King or a Queen inside each of us.
But for the majority of people it is suppressed by cloud and fog. 
I know for myself, the internal journey requires consistent investigation and effort.
I live in the 1st world, I'm time poor and bombarded by distractions and most people around me are just treading water in the struggle. 
When I peer into the internal mirror of my soul it is caked with dust, grit and scum.
On a daily basis I need to make an effort to clean, to polish the mirror, the main tools for me is prayer, gratitude and service, but it is different for everyone, for others it maybe meditation or surfing or playing with a pet or child.
No the King and Queen is not for everyone, it is only for those who take action and quest for it.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/9, 8:36am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I have served a lot of kings and queens in my hospitality life and I'm very familiar to the good and bad that goes with this position, I have seen how some that were graceful and honourable  with the position and I have seen some that had failed miserably. It a horrible sight when you see someone fall from greatness. Like in a game of chess the King and or queen are always a point of target.
David Cruwys
6/9, 8:37am
David Cruwys
I hear you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/9, 8:38am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
But as for small buisness you can. Disguise yourself as a pawn by not being such a show of with material goods when really you are a queen  or king
Your not a target but part of a community
Or a number of communities better
More contemporary than the stuffy old monarchy
David Cruwys
6/9, 8:40am
David Cruwys
I'm for knowing I'm a king at heart, whilst living in humility both inside and in how I represent myself to the community.
Unlike the game of chess though, I think the King and the Queen support each other and present a united front
The idea of partnership (I'll use the word marriage, but I understand that term is a little antiquitated)
My wife depends on me and I depend on her, we support each other. That's how marriage is supposed to work.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki

Tonight I danced the elements five
And there I danced my angel alive
As i moved my feat while the  music pumped
From the earth I felt her heartbeat thump
A wind arose, blowing skirt of lace
And there she stood, what beauty, what grace?
From my loins arose a fire that flared
To entwine this girl, to feel us paired.
She offered a cup of water sublime,
She kissed my lips, this goddess devine.
Said the radiant spirit, let our hearts merge together. 
I looked in her eyes, said I'll love you forever.

Thank you David you are so good to me, I love you. This is a testing time and and thank god if it was not for my meditation and yoga a  Julia bomb would have landed on this household. I am taking on your gratitude way of thinking whilst I navigate my emotions , taking a breath and observing calmly is essential. It will be intrasting as my more interactions with Peter today I am shifting from my old ways of reacting, which I'm grateful for , good morning. David I hope you have a wonderful day  xo

Sorry I typed a few things , basically a work in progress
The bonus is I am inspired by the situation to work harder on my business, and set things up so when I move into my own place I have a good  buisness foundation set up. Loads of work I, need to just get focused
Whilst Sebastian is away I would really like to work this weekend, though the thought of indulging with you this weekend is so tempting, just to run and hide in your arms for a couple of days. Not to think about anything but us would be woundful
David Cruwys
6/14, 9:20pm
David Cruwys
Be mindful that you and i have not had an opportunity to connect like we could this weekend and due to the nature of both our lives we can't just do that anytime we like

David I love you, that has not changed. I am changing and growing.
I am inspired by upheaval at home to work harder on my goals
I had set out to do ,
My sister is my inspiration, my mum is my inspiration
They challenge me to become better
I know they love me as they are tough with  me
They know I can take it
I have purpose with a goal and a time limit of 6 months
My sister is blazing a trail for me
My mum and John have set me a foundation, I have what I need to be anything I dream of being
I'm now at a point in my life to live the life I was always dreaming of when I was stuck in my marriage
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/15, 11:54pm

Good morning David, I love you, 
during my practice I was thinking of you and the beautiful poems you had spent the time to write to me, you have helped me so much to feeling confident in myself,
I thank you for letting me face my fears sexually you have helped me free my mind o those fears, I thank you for our conversations and our no bullshit honesty with each other. I love you for that I didn't mean to make you feel guilty about the time with you is taking me away from my time with my friends, this was sa. Observation that I have the power to change with no fault to you only for me to make the responsibility to make time for my circle of friends. 
You inspire me with your commitment to your friends and I should do the same as one of the issues I have done in past relationships is give my heart body and sole to my relationship and this is not good, I need to hold my energy, I need to hold my focus on the goals I want to a have  in my life I need to be mindful and make a point of scheduling phone call time with my friends, I want to share beautiful moments with you with dance and have the freedom to move with you on a deeper level, when the opportunity presents itself .

Oops David Cat doesn't want you to come to the Kirtain tomorrow night, something happened, whilst you were dating her?
David Cruwys
6/18, 11:29am
David Cruwys
Wow really
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/18, 11:29am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yep she just messaged me now
David Cruwys
6/18, 11:32am
David Cruwys
Thats interesting, but I guess understandable. The only thing that ever happened whilst dating was that she found someone and did not want to continue dating
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/18, 11:35am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Hmm strange
Maybe a boundary thing
David Cruwys
6/18, 11:37am
David Cruwys
Could be. I personally found it a little unsettling myself to be at world bridgers with her there
I would imagine it is much worse for her
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/18, 12:17pm
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Sure, I would still like to go as quite a few of my friends are going and I really need to connect with that group

Alchemical magic this second FULL MOON in Sagittarius coinciding with the SOLSTICE, on 20/21 June. ~ Both SUN and MOON at their peak align to bring us illumination of the patterns that need to be rewoven within our own psyche, within our relationships and within the greater collective Reality. The arrow of Truth is swift and on point bearing the way. On this ¤FULL MOON SOLSTICE¤ day, take time to be still and connect your heart to the beating, pulsing heart of the cosmos. Like our ancestors before us, we are reminded that we are part of it, an intrinsic part of the cosmic weave “It’s been a very confusing time for many and with the second Full Moon in Sadge illuminating the skies there is a big energy up around personal and collective Truth which necessarily requires that we also look at personal and collective delusion, deception, illusion and denial. “This Full Moon is at 29’32 Sagittarius- activating the karmic completion degree which occurs at the last degree of every sign… “So we have this image of not only chapters completing but perhaps a whole volume of life ending. “The Sun/Moon opposition straddles the 29th degree of Gemini and Sadge- showing that major crisis points, completions and endings are occurring in regards to our perception of Truth and our capacity to live aligned by it…” “The desire to escape is strong right now and yet the path of mastery requires we stay the course, stay embodied and show up to do the work. “It’s interesting to note that the Sun/Moon opposition is not the only activation of the karmic completion degree. “We also have Juno, the asteroid Goddess of partnership and marriage, at 29 Libra…” “Juno essentially comes to a standstill at 29 Libra- so from now until July 7th we are in deeply karmic territory in relationships, commitments and contracts in our lives. There are definite major karmic completions going on right now. “Whether significant relationships are ending for good or longtime karmic patterns of relating to others is what is ending (or both)- there’s some deep stuff to navigate in the realm of relationships…” “Libra is the sign of the scales which brings to mind the justice card in the tarot. Right now the scales are being rectified- with all parties needing to account for their part in things in order for healing or closure to happen. “Navigate this month wisely- and focus on completing karmic patterns you are finally good and ready to leave behind!” “Another layer of energy gets added in when we notice that Juno is journeying with Black Moon Lilith right now as well. They conjoined on May 29th and will do so again on September 11th…” “With Juno traversing with BML we also have an interesting juxtaposition of the Goddess of commitment and the Dark Goddess of freedom and independence. “With both in underworld Scorpio there can be big shadows up right now around fear of engulfment (BML shadow) or fear of abandonment (Juno shadow) and the things we do to avoid feeling all the emotions that arise when either of this are experienced…” “To add to the relational focus we have Venus, the Goddess of Love and beauty, conjunct the Sun and opposite the Full Moon- so we have another indicator that we are being asked to redress imbalances in relationships…” “Luckily Venus trines Black Moon Lilith in Scorpio- bringing a deeply psychic, intuitive, spiritual and magical energy into the chart. “Add in the trine to Neptune in Pisces and we have a Grand Water Trine formed between the lower heart (Venus), the Higher Heart (Neptune) and the fierce Dark Feminine (Lilith). “When we can access deep compassion and unconditional Love and at the same time see beyond the facade of the ego to get to the heart of the Truth– no matter how dark or hidden or wounded that Truth may be- then real healing can happen. “The Full Moon is also in a wide trine to Uranus, Eris and Ceres- a triple conjunction of the Rebel and Revolutionary, the Goddess of upheaval and chaos and the Great Mother asteroid Goddess of loss and renewal…” “Uranus comes in like wild fire- clearing out what is no longer valid and supportive for our growth. Eris is similar in nature- she throws the apple of discord into our lives to show us what is out of integrity and needing to be faced and addressed. “And Ceres is in there to support us in moving through the transitional spaces of loss and renewal so we don’t get stuck in the birth portal between death of the old and birth of the new. “Luckily the ruler of this lunation is Jupiter- the planet of expansion, growth and positivity. His alignment with the evolutionary north node is bringing in MAJOR POTENTIAL for new growth, evolution and positive change (Jupiter aligns with the mean north node on June 24th). “Add in Pluto in Capricorn’s trine to both Jupiter (June 26th) and the North Node (June 16th) and we can see that this portal of time from June 16th to the 26th is POWERFUL. “It’s a potent time of manifestation and actualization- but the key to make it work the most for you is that you have to be very clear on what you are calling in/anchoring into and you have to be very clear on what you are leaving behind…” “I leave you with Ellias Lonsdale’s Star Sparks meditation for the last degree of Sagittarius: “There is an assignment, a destiny task which falls to me. I am asked to take each and every situation I come into and to witness the pattern, the design, the way it goes. Then I release it through me. “I take everything that has been and I let it all go. Sometimes this is very arduous. Other times it is instantaneous, effortless. It doesn’t matter. Whatever way it is, I’ll be there. “I am fascinated and engrossed in the human dilemma, the soul drama. I have an endless appetite for putting things together and taking them apart. But I am very serious and intent in all that I do. “It is one of those tasks that is almost too crucial to let myself be aware of. I don’t want to get in the way. So I pretend it’s just the way I pass time. I act as casual and cool as possible, even with myself. Oddly enough, it works. “The truth is, though, that there is nothing more vital than what I do. Because I’m around, things move differently. I’m a cross between a catalyst and a loyal follower of the existing pattern as long as I possibly can. “My impulse is to preserve, if possible. When that’s not happening, I will get in there and make it obvious that this is not the way the flow is supposed to go. “I am immensely powerful and deeply hidden. I work between the lines. But I am so good at what I do. I can spend extended cycles in the outlandish assignments. And I will look and act straight the whole while. “I’ve got a job to do. I am witnessing the whole thing but sometimes you just gotta pay close attention to the weave.” (~ Ellias Lonsdale from his Star Sparks) © Copyright 2016 DIVINE HARMONY http://www.mysticmamma.com/full-moon-in-sagittarius-solstice-june-20th-2016/ art: The Star Child Tarot, http://www.thehoodwitch.com/blog/2015/9/21/starchild-an-interview-with-danielle-noel

I was reading about that Sagittarius alignment last night anoth friend on Facebook had posted a similar article
Good morning Julia
Im glad i am looking after myself to
I know its because I have a degree of self love that I have not had for some time
David Cruwys
6/21, 6:29am
David Cruwys
But there is also an amplification of that self love from the energy I feel around you
I am often give out my own energy in relationships but too often the woman I have been in relationship with have been energy vampires
I find it is far more bio directional with you
I love that you seem to have a healthy balance between holding yourself in a contained state and also giving selflessly
David Cruwys
6/21, 6:42am
David Cruwys
My biggest lesson this year has been around staying grounded in relationship . There has been some little storms this last few months and i have mostly held my own containment during those periods
I have shared my emotional insecurities with my sponsor or other spiritual advisors and that has helped me to be objective and tap into a wisdom i would nit find on my own
It has also allowed me to be far less reactive or to share negative emotions with you, thus helping me to hold appropriate internal boundaries
I don't know what our future holds, but does not matter too much at the moment as i have found living in the moment with you both easy and rewarding
I  know we don't write as much here anymore but I personally find this journaling to be healthy
Have a wonderful day Squeeky ;)
Love you xo

I'm keen to catch up with Izabella for lunch Thursday and talk more to her about energy fields.

Good morning Julia,  it's nice waking up while dreaming about you. Many good memories from last night, looking at you in that blue jumper and thinking you look cute, holding your hand while witnessing our amazing city through martin place and hyde park, practicing dance in Hyde park, sitting on a park bench while you pour me some tea, watching your ass undulate in kizoomba,  dancing during class and especially feeling your boonda flowing in rhythm while my eyes were closed with you in my arms and finishing the night with you in my lap with long kisses, cheek brushing and breath exchanges. I feel so good with you Julia

Good morning David I love having  a journal record of each of our nights spent together. FYI I haven't deleted any of our messenger record , only the explicit stuff that I prefer to remember as an intimate connection rather than in writing, as it then becomes something that I am uncomfortable with.
I'm looking forward to tonight I'm wearing a skirt for the occasion. ??
I have a studio full of women so I won't connect until this afternoon .xo

Though with the last quote photo I sent I think he was talking about the superficial self improvement what we share is our a hunger to grow from our past mistakes heal and to make spiritually nourishing choices. To offer to the world now understanding our boundaries and our limitations so we don't crumble and break again, life lessons of personal boundaries is the gold that holds me together, with its shiny quality it is something to alway notice and celebrate rather than hide and resent.

Oh BTW, you said earlier that you have kept our conversations here as your journal, I have taken that a little step further by writing some software to extract that information in to a data structure that can be processed into something else (not sure what that something else is yet), but it takes our FB messages and groups them by date and who said it.

Thank you for the date David I had a fun night, not sure what happened at the end but I couldn't open the door and your reaction threw me.
David Cruwys
6/25, 12:12am
David Cruwys
I was thinking of it
I was in a degree of fear and shame around making love in the office
I was kind off beating myself up around it
My energy was very out of sorts at the end but i did not what to project any of it onto you
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/25, 12:16am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
Yeah I don't want to do that again at the end of the night
There's something else I'm sure in time
David Cruwys
6/25, 12:18am
David Cruwys
I just want to remember the dinner
The play
The slow breaths and movement on the train platform
Its interesting that we can be fine being romantic in public or down on the beach. But in your car or my office and one of us freaks out

Because its ny office
But you freak out when its your car
But i think the reasons are similar

Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
I shared my energy with you David last night I can't change how I feel.I'll refill hopefully with yoga and enjoy my moments with Sebastian , it's served me before it will serve me again, last night confirmed the power of energy shifts. I'll be mindful of that from now on. Have a great day xo
David Cruwys
6/25, 7:13am
David Cruwys
I am honoured that you shared your energy with me, i am grateful for the night we had.
I was also caught up in a shame spiral last night that was robbing me.
My language for that feeling is described in AA as the spiritual malady and is the true reason why I ever stayed in AA, because Alcoholism has nothing to do with alcohol, alcoholism is centered in the mind. 
I'm happy you can refill on yoga,  i too will refill with a meeting this morning. 
I am also driven to find a new home ASAP, I need to have my own space so that I can feel centered.
Thank you for all of last night, especially how the night ended. I say that not because I am happy in how it ended but because of the objective awareness that I could see around my own fears and shame.
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
6/25, 7:21am
Julia Lesiuk Sawicki
David Thank god for my practice and thank god for for your open communication, thank god for messenger as with it we have a contract that reminds us of how not to repeat our fuck ups experience,  learn, reflect let go move forward and enjoy the new day with more knowledge of my boundry's as to what sucks and what refills. 
I have freedom I have choices I choose I life that fills me not drains me, have a great meeting xx
David Cruwys
6/25, 7:28am
David Cruwys
Im thankful for this journal to. You mentioned let go and move forward. Thats one of the challenges of an alcoholic. We have a common catch phrase called "let go, let God" because resentment  (at others or SELF) its what takes as out of the game real quick . Without my program i hold onto the feelings of last night for a period that is way longer then is healthy for me and thus perpetuating the shame spiral. The open communication of this journal gives me a powerful tool

Treat after sex like after yoga the resting pose, it is the most important, if you just ejaculate then rush off and break that spiritual connection that's why I thought you had snorted some drugs as you were so disjointed  you changed so much it was really fucked up you were happy to spend the time to build up the connection regardless of of your boss coming in or not but when you came and even when we were dressed I couldn't open the door to use the bathroom you turned to me like I was an idiot for not being able to open it, that was fucked that was a total change in you.
Maybe you were showing me your true spirit, not something played out from tantra or regurgitated from Aand A
David Cruwys
6/25, 9:11am
David Cruwys
I'm happy to communicate what was going on for ne but I think it will require verbal communication
Ket ne know if you are free to chat sometime
I found a lot of clarity around my behavior in my morning reflections
For my part, especially my reaction around opening the door, I am sorry
Like all "reactions", it was born from something deep seated

Good night David not many have seen me cry I'm usually very guarded with that, to many things just seemed to build up and the tears and anger weren't all about the other night just a whole lot of shit, I have made quick notes and will journal when I have time, and talk with therapist, I need to see her before I make any decisions  I will be pulling back, I don't repeat actions that hurt me but today was a sad day and I was craving feel good things, dancing which I did cuddles with my son and I was also fantasising a lot  with other feel good things, yeah I need to talk about this with my therapist. You have been really good to me David xo

Hi thanks for the call David
Just for the record for messenger 
Communication between us has been a point in my life of navigating a new world after the trauma of divorce.
It has been an intense few months 
That I have grown stronger from.
I hope you honour my wishes as discussed on the phone. Hard copy I prefer of our communication , pleas destroy the digital record.
Pleas respect these documents  as confidential. 
I know you enjoy our interaction on messenger, coming from a space of a person that has overcome his trauma, in a private and confidential space such as A and A and therapy 
Please respect my wishes for privacy of my healing period this is a time that I had mostly navigated by my intuition by my heart by my spiritual guides, pleas respect the sacred space it deserves on hard copy away from the digital world.
David Cruwys
6/27, 2:03pm

Good morning Julia,  i hope that every morning when you wake there is something from me to leave a smile on your face and warmth in your heart.
This morning I want to gift you my latest poem.
I call it "Julia's Place"
She invited me softly, come into my sacred place,
Such beauty,  so lovely, with elegance and taste.
As bright as a star, she gives me such hope,
Dave ... Don't mess it up; Just don't be a dope.
Cause when we dance,  she is my cure,
I love this romance, so gentle, so pure.
When I make her laugh,  she chimes like a bell,
and when she smiles, my heart starts to swell.
But alas I'm not perfect,  I know I have shadow, 
Said the wise woman once, BEWARE; the raven card tarot.
So I take on each day, I strive for my light, 
Pursuing this dream, to the grave I will fight. 
For now I have purpose, I will never hesitate, 
For she is my reason, my beautiful soul mate.

Good morning David, had a wonderful meditation, I brought the abundance of universal energy of white light in and than  visualised the abundant energy overflowing from the top of my head and raining down to my feet in gold like a water fall around my body, then projected the abundant universal energy to all of whom I love including you, i prayed that you find your sacred space David xo

I had a good sleep this morning and I was just looking online for something to watch while I got ready and watched this particular video and it was a little instghtful for me


Yep I'm fully aware of insomnia and the value of meditation
I saw you were up at 10 pm
I also shared a meditation video on my wall, just really a reinforcement of what you already know
but it was good
I ended up going to bed around 11:30
I was writing and learning and researching
but it was a relaxed kind of education

I think yoga is essentiall in life
I felt really good this morning
I tried sleeping, but I have problems going to bed too early
my brain is currently tuned to late nights

I think I'm opening intuitively again from the dreams last night
that's good to hear
Snakes and people having sex
What sort of energy was that producing?

No it wasn't just that, symbolism
Anyway it posses questions to then be answered via meditation
Fair enough
I have to focus on work now

Don't worry now about it just something to do later
I know your busy
I just tested it
sending you a screen shot from me
it looks ok
my suggestion though is that you push forward on a theme update, because old themes (like yours) will have issues on all sorts of browser configurations that you have not thought of that people would be using

marketing has more power then parents

Such rubbish stick insect better

It's just hype had an argument with mum encouraging it
I guess it is hard when she is not on your side

Sales email templates_Infusionsoft.pdf

Hi David just was thinking about last night and had a great evening dancing and connecting intimately.
Didn't appreciate the comments about back door/ front door , I have never  disrespect you in regards to what we do intimately. Why did you do that?
My intention was not to disrespect you Julia
it was just a play on words in the moment
I'm sorry if it came across as disrespectful
I'm sorry for the comment, it was thoughtless

Yes it was it makes me think if you are so easy to make a comment like that to my face. what are you like with other people, kind of makes me question your I integrity
That is not comedy
it was a play on words in the moment, as I have said, it was a mistake and I am sorry

I trusted you David to explore intimacy further, i never made play of word about you, if this what you usually do to have a laugh ( to yourself , I was not laughing felt embarrassed
I understand, and as I have said, I am sorry
I can see that it would bring shame
My intention is never to bring shame or embarassement to you,
I think you know me well enought, to know that I go out of my way in a 1000 ways for you and always go the extra mile to make you feel special
I was particulary happy with last night, because you talked about in bed your ability to go deeper and more intimate with me
I am grateful for that
my off the cuff remark was a mistake in the moment, but it is not my nature and I think I have demonstrated that many times over and over
I find it challenging that you would questiong my integrity around you

That's what I don't understand after sharing my feelings and intimacy you say shit like that
I don't know David you have said you have made a lot of changes since going out with me I'm I seeing glimmers of your true colours, I ask this question seriously, are you showing me your true colours ?
A person being true to who he is shouldn't exspress it as an effort
I can't really defend my self anymore, I said sorry, you either forgive or you don't. 

But please keep in mind that if my side of the street is truly so dirty, please take a look at your side of the street and ask the question. Have I always treated David with respect in the last 6 months when I'm around other people or have I treated david as a dance partner and a person to be ashamed off.

I don't generally like to question your integrity, but you need to realise that there have been more then a few moments where I have felt like I am un-important to you. 

I hope I have never made you feel un-important and I try to learn from my mistakes when I do, but Julia, you have had a number of instances with you where you have left me feeling like shit

Ehvbs
Thank you for clarifying our relationship
I don't feel comfortable to continue as I'm not more my family are ready for a boyfriend and yes i agree it's not going to work having a private relationship like we do
I have always said that and I haven't ment to disrespect you I never have
Thank you for your honesty I'm grateful this has been looked at seriously. I think our journey has ended
One of the things I find trully challenging about you, is that I am given no freedom to talk about my side or my point of view, because it just leads to you breaking up.

How can you be in love with someone, and so shatteringly destructive at the same time. 

I have loved you as unconditionally as humanly possible. I wish you felt a 10th of that for me.

I have always been upfront about our relationship and communicated honestlywith you don't undermine that I have not
everytime things have gotton difficult, you have ended the relationship. Don't underestimate the fear and uncertainty that creates for me
Regarding: 
>> I don't feel comfortable to continue as I'm not more my family are ready for a boyfriend

What's really unfortunate is that the truth is probably closer to (you are not ready for a boyfriend).

I understand that Sebastian would never really want to know about any boyfriend you might have, but as for 
the rest of your family, I think they would want you to be happy and in love. I got on well with Astrid's 
Mum, I get on well with Isabella and I'm totally confident that I would get on well with Nina.

I may be wrong, but I don't believe your family really would have a problem with you being happy with a guy who loves you, 
respects you and looks out for your interests, its unfortunate that you can't see that.
OCT 30TH, 3:25PM

Remember the conversion we had at the Botanical gardens I appreciate you answering my concerns in the last thread
if you think so, I've not asked to be part of your family, even to this day, but I know that they proballly would not have a problem with me
but what really hurts is that any sort of honest comunication (comming from me) is a just an opportunity for you end the relationship
it has allways been like that and it has been dibilittating to live in that constant anxiety with you

I had questions that concern both of us

Coming from a divorce I had a lot of conditions with any intimate relationship that I was really uncertain to peruse and never been totally  comfortable with it isn't healthy for either of us.
When I told my sister I had started a relationship with you she told me to be carful as girls who are emotionally vaunrable after relationship breakdown are always an easy target
Do you think I'm a preditor?

I didn't say that my sister nina said that
The timing was not the best, but I love you and have done for quite some time
and while I have my defects of character, being a fucking preditor and pray on vulnerable women does not come close to who I am

I'm feeling emotionally exhausted I can't do this
bye

I have no one to talk to about this. Bye
neither do I julia, because you have become the person that I confide in
We were going some well, I don't understand how it goes south so quickly

It was not going well for eather of us, so soon after after a divorce I have had complete emotional turmoil in dealing with everything around me I was able to deal with things with yoga meditation and having strict boundaries that at the end of the day didn't work for you or for me, it hurts me a great deal David  I wish I could run away from my responsibilities but I can't give up on my family
I'm not asking you to run away from your responsibilities, but I am cut to the core when you call into question my integrity around you, whilst at the same time living in a lie that you know has an impact on me
I have always accept the impact
but its a challenge when I can't even share a truth with you without you wanting to end it all

David I have not been single in 14 years let alone divorce I new it was was not right to have s relationship that is not open I have always had my concerns I'm living and learning and also sorry I know it was not right and I'll learn from that
I know you know that

I don't want to look at our relationships as a mistake as it has brought great emotional richness
To me with my healing
Is the rwal question about whether i have in some way done something monumentally wrong that deserves us separating
Or is the real question should you be single

David I believe we were ment to meet and you have as I repeat been massive in my healing
I'm not ready for a relationship until my family are
It's not fair for anyone
Secret relationship I know now don't work and just cause hurt for both involved
I hate I can't talk openly with my parents about what we do
I hate when I do say something mum has an exspression   of please don't
I understand
Just at least be honest with me about why you are ending it
If You need to be single then i will deal with that

I'm in tears at the moment writing to you whilst looking after my son
Im sorry, lets leave it
I will cone by and you can chat with me after his bed if you like

I need for him to see me as strength his queen for him to thrive
I can't David I'm feeling low and we know what happens when I'm with you when I'm like this
I need to travel this out
Journal
Goodnight goodbye
OCT 31ST, 9:51PM

I think I left my shoes in your car
I am at AA tomorrow night i will try to remember to grab them on my way

It's ok no rush
NOV 1ST, 10:41AM

Thank you for the Snapchat message it means a lot to me David,
You mean a lot to me and you always will
You may not want a relationship with me
but you have changed my life this year in a really powerful way
and while I'm hurting
I am also very grateful for the journey
I'm also aware that you tend to remain friends with ex's and I don't want to see you out of my life
but that sort of future, is for another time

I'm so grateful for you during my healing but it is unfair to not have a totally open relationship
it is unfair

I won't do that again
don't
it is painful for the other person
but I have no regrets

I know now
Sorry for your pain but I think I felt the quake of unease when you kissed me on the dance floor thinking my family would see
I thnk you need to look at particular feeling

That confirmed I could do this
I think I need time to be single
I think you need to look at the idea that your family and friends ultimately want you to be happy

I know
i understand that being happy may mean being single
but a good man in your life (a good friend, a good lover, a good person to bounce ideas of and to just hold you) can also be very enriching for you and I know that your family want that for you in the end
your son, would not understand that

I need that time to grow in myself find myself I can't do that whilst in a relationship
but everyone else would
yeah, I know
Well, I hope you are still my friend

Yes David
I want to be your friend but let's give space
yeah, thats why I did not go dancing last night
I can't really be around you yet
I'm hurting really deeply

Ok umm what about class
but I keep going back to gratitudes and meditation and that is helping

I only have a couple of months that I can do them
I don't know

Befor my life changes yet again
I may go of in a different direction with my dance, different schools if I can get out of my contract

Ok
Or at least differnt class scheduels
Right now seeing you is not fun for me

Look I'll always be respectful of you
But I don't know if I can be
My emotions sometimes get the better of me
and I don't want to regret how I may be while emotional
I have learned to never communicate with someone while emotional, thats why I don't tend to make first contact with you (during this time and the other times)

Let's just not chat if at class I understand if you want to skip me extra
I try to pause when adjutated
ok

Ok
Have a good day, oh are you doing the palladium weekend?
If you are I won't do it
I think it is too expensive for me
I have contacted pedro about the tickets for next year
I think it is for SLF? is that right

The special ended last night
shut
shit

That's why I was buzzing around
Last minute
Ok I have to get back to work I can pick up my stuff on my way home one night
BTW: Joneel is in the skype window, he has a 15 yours at 6$ AUD per hour and needs to be paid with the "Friends and Family" option so that you absorbe the fees

Yep I'll do that now
Thanks for that

What's the total amount?
$91.62
Can you confirm if this is correct
15 & 1/2 hour * 6 = $93 AUD


I'm not sure how I'm suppose to pay
Do I go into PayPal
Need to create paypal account
sign in
and pay someone using the firends and family option

Ok
to be honest, I have not paid anyone (myself) in 3 years
so options may have cahnged

I'll give It a go

All done

Who cut your hair
Never mind
$20, shave it off dude

Fuck

it can grow out again in the future


Hmm
Only just noticed it
Hmm
I was going to rcord that video with helmet and forgot

Please don't do that again
I was in a bit of a FU state when I did that haircut
I don't not really calm down until about 9pm last night when I did my meditation and gratitude list
did you see that video?
a lot of calmness came to me last night, I'm going to start doing more Qi Goong

Only from this morning
Fantastic
I could not see last nights video either, not sure why
but I'm going to continue a number of the spiritual principals
that I have been developing whilst with you
they are good for me

Lots of reflection for me mum saw me in a state the other night I usually cover that stuff up
She's sending me on a retreat this weekend
BTW, when is the yoga weekend?

Just to sort my shot out
I'm glad you are doing that

Shit out
Did you tell her why you were in that state?

no
I don't talk to her about you as I know what she is going to say
I'll talk to Melicia laters
I keep saying to you, that your family would probabally be happy for you were truly happy
they may not like things at first, they may not like change
but they love you and want the best

I'm not ready
I need calm
I get that, I think what I really came to understand over the last couple of days

I just want calm
is that you are the one with the issue
not them
and you need to sort that issue out

I know, let me
I am

Ok
have a good day

You to
NOV 1ST, 10:30PM

David do you have a lot of colleges connected with you on snap chat?
Just concerned ??
No

Ok
Are you using it as a journaling medium
Maybe a little
But more of my journaling is in my step 10 book

How was AA
Maybe I cane across as depressed in that last video. But i am actually going well
It was good for me

Yeah it did
I connected with my sponsor and a new Comer
Maybe its my melencolic voice
I'm in a bit of relief at moment.  I dont have to feel like i need to be perfect
And im working really hard
And i have seen an opportunity for a job that is in my street
Other end of lavender st
And i am going to go for it

I'm sorry you felt that you had to be different
With me
I'm grateful that you give me drive and purpose

I'm glad your looking for other work and moving forward
But I also feel like you need the perfect person and I can't live there all the time

It seemed of been something that was on your cards to do for awhile
I thought we had fun I didn't relize it was stressful
We do have fun
We have great communication
We have a level of intimacy that I have never experienced that gives me such depth of feeling

David I felt I was being pushed
You challenge me to be the best i can be and I like that

To do things I wasn't ready to do
Like what Julia

You think that by meeting my family you wouldn't be meeting my son
That he wouldn't know
It's not so much about the meeting of the family

I'm about to take on another big change in my life
You miss the point a bit

I get anxious with changes and moving and thinking about how Sebastian is going to be
Yeah I get that you do

I already experienced lashing out before
From who
Him

When I wasn't completely there for him during the move I was doing one car load at a time then dancing to keep my mood up he lashed out and was effected greatly by that
Aswell as working and keeping my business going
I hear you

I just need to be focused on my work and him and I need also to have alone time to reflect on what I'm doing during the process
I'm up late tonight work and it feels great
I got so much done
Sebastian was so excited that I played monopoly ect
I noticed
He looks happy
Do you know why I feel like I need to be perfect around you

Why
You wanting to break up from me to spend more time with Sebastian, or focus on work or whatever, generallyu makes sense to me
But you never breakup with me for those reasons (5 times you have broken up with )
the last two in particulre, I asked (begged) you not to just loose the plot and break up with me
and those times that you have broken up with me have always been about some transgression that I have made, nothing terrible, just totally human
so I end up living in fear, anxiety, etc... about put the best foot forward
which is terrible for me
and bad for us as two people in a relationship
yet, those transgressions, are only a cover for your own anxieties

Yes
its been so hurtfull, to live as the person who has made a mistake and then had to bear the responsibility of it
when the actually action has very little to do with the reason for the break up
and it is only ever well after the event, when you calm down and talk about it that I get to see the truth
I'm not saying tyha to minimize, anything I do
but in case, I have done 3 things
said I was sorry
said I would try to be better
and asked for forgiveness
and you never accept it
you break up with
and then I'm destroyed internally
and also left feeling like I fucked up
and thats why I feel a sense of releif
because its been building up with each of the breakups
its had an effect on me, that has not only been hurtful, but has left me question things that I should not have to question
it has also harmed my feelings towards you

That's why I need to be single
I know

That's why my mum my sister had said it was to soon
That's why I had said I don't want to be kissed
Stop saying that, that's not quite correct
anyone can make valid arguments that it was too soon, I can agree

That's why I have to break up because boundaries are alway overlooked
but if you did not get into a relationship with me

That's why it creates a toxic relationship that we have now!!!
you would not have had the growth and beautiy that you have had
I cherish what we have had
and I don't agree that what it is now is toxic

Yes it is
it has had some toxic elements
thats true, but it is not toxic
I have been in toxic relationships, I know what they are

So have i David
you and i (can, thought of late havn't) communicated really well
and when we are commujnicating, we don't have any toxic stuff
and bad experiences (which we have had some of)
are not toxic
they are just bad experiences

Quote from above 
it has also harmed my feelings towards you
I was thiniking of that quote when I replied

It has become more toxic with each break up
and while that aspect has been toxic

Your not to blame I am
Fine
and has led to a decline of feelings (especially with the last one)

It's not your fault
I know that relationships go in cycles

Fine
they go up
they go down
they go sideways
and also know that it goes like that for some period of time
before both people find the marurity to and the communication that is needed for it to stay in an up state
we really good in the honey moon phase

David I'm not having an intimate relationship with anyone it's not healthy for anyone
but we not been so good on the communication in the last 2 months
i'm not hear, arguing to get back together

David it's late
I think you should be single
but I think, it may be healthy for you and I to at least continue this dialog at some stage while it is still fresh
I hope you can give that

Why is it healthy
because it is realy communication from both our feelings, it provides growth, it provides understanding
otherwise you and I are destined to make the same mistakes
either with each other or other people
I'm not looking to get back together, its not about that

I should not of been in an intimate relationship in the first place
I'm also not looking to stick a scalpel into you
I don't want to burn you
but I think you and I can have a real conversation that is healing

I have never been single since I was 21
It's, ok
You should be single
I'm not asking for a change of mind
I know that for you and I to get back together (like we have done in the past) would be toxic
you and I need some time to find rebuild some of our (self)

This is going to be the Change in my life of knowing and learning how to be single I have always gone from one relationship into another it's not healthy
My relationship will be with my son
My family
With me
sure
Good night Julia

Good night
I did not meant to bring any heat to your heart tonight
I wish you peace, sweet dreams, more beautiful nights of monopoly with your sone

I feel drained
and also wanted to say that the
last 4 images that you posted on SnapChat
were really realy wonderful
I loved the colour in them

Thanks good night

NOV 8TH, 4:10AM
I don't really get star signs but the description fir Virgo seems spot on
Yep and Capricorn is fairly accurate
Hope you had a good night dancing. I am getting an early Qi Goong and ride to work in. Have a good day Julia
NOV 8TH, 7:21AM

It was a great night to ride and dance, lots of LJ people. Have a great day .

NOV 8TH, 8:48AM

Today, 8:8 is potentially a day of experiencing unlimited power. So start by asking yourself, 'What is true power?' Personally I feel personal power is the ability to take right action and make a difference. However we must then surrender the outcome to a higher power or we will feel powerless if we try to control everything through our actions. Warning: I'm now going to reflect on the mythic relevance of the US election, given the astro energies so if that bothers you, don't read on. I had already thought Nov 8 a very auspicious date for the US election, since November is the 8th sign of the zodiac & 8 is about abundance and power. Why? 8 is the infinity sign - it's unlimited energy. The moon is also waxing at first quarter, so it's generating energy and power in Aquarius, the sign of the reformer - one who does what's needed to serve the people & people power. With the Sun in Scorpio, the sign of transformation, this will hopefully be a turning point for the most dominant patriarchal power in our global village. News Flash! In typical Aquarius moon fashion - something unexpected has come to light! I had a nagging remembrance about the dates of the Cross-Quarter festivals being altered in some way and my intuition wouldn't let it rest as I sensed there was more to the date, Nov 8 being selected for the presidential puppet show. Sure enough, those occultists pulling the strings in the shadow government have selected the exact date of Halloween. Allow me to explain... It seems when the Julian calendar was introduced by Pope Gregory in 1582, 10 days were omitted that year, so October 5 became October 15. The dates of the Solstices were adjusted to reflect this change but not the cross-quarter festivals - the dates half way between the solstices & equinoxes. So whilst the Scorpio sun transit with it's polarity of Taurus has elicited Halloween / Beltane vibes, the window when the worlds will be unveiled is Nov 8. Here's the link to read more: http://www.northernway.org/school/way/calendar/halloween.html And a couple of sites which offer an astronomical point of view: http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/2016.html http://www.hermetic.ch/eqsol/eqsol.htm So, what to make of that? Well, Halloween (in the US) is the beginning of the Fall, the descent journey into the dark months. So this could be the beginning of the fall of a superpower or the symbolic end of patriarchy with a female president at the helm. This is like the final showdown of the Piscean Age - polar opposites squaring off when the sun & moon are forming a square. My intuition says the Scorpio woman will 'trump' Trump and kill his massive ego. (He has his ascendent in Leo). The sun is shining on Scorpio presently and Trump epitomises patriarchal values which are the old paradigm. So with the moon now in Aquarius highlighting the values of the Aquarian Age, people are going to want to feel as if they're moving forwards by doing something completely different. Then again after a democrat the last 8 yrs for others that might be voting for a Republican. Either way this result will shock & that's what Aquarius promises a shock that's electrifying! Blessings on your day, Tanishka
The Moon Woman
Interesting prophecy from the moon woman regarding election

Just testing this
To see if I can scan
it looks good
does it scan?
I would suggest a different profile picture

Not working
May be the ghost needs to be empty
would not have thought so
have you resized the YELLOW at all
or is that based on the origanl

It scans but then a smug emoji face com's up with Lol

best way to debug these issues, is to start with an original workign version
then just add bits to it one at a time
till you find out where the issue is


Thanks yes I'll play later

I'm in the middle of going over my assets for my resume and I came across this video/article that I did a share on back in 2014. 

Its a Poetry Slam Finalist from Princeton and I can see the inspiration from one of the women who did the Poetry slam this year at the Opera House
http://www.ideasmen.com.au/poem-patrick-roche-21

I'll look at it a little later just cleaning the pets
NOV 13TH, 4:08PM

Powerful poem, was this what happened with you and Steve?
If your 6 years sober Steve was 15 when you started AA, a year after you had moved out from the family with him, tough for him.

NOV 13TH, 8:48PM

How was Kiz
Was just at balmoral retunder looked liked it need to be danced on
Fun memory
Thats a memory i cherish greatly
That was one week after our first breakup
But it was also magical

We will never break up again
Which is nice
Nice for you maybe

What you like breaking up
I don't
Font worry
Dancing was wonderful

I have only had 7 partners
Not a thing I do lightly
I've only had one that I truly wanted as a partner

David you have only been part of a small part of my life
I know

Everything else that goes with partnership
Has to synergies in every aspect
I would have moved the world to make it work

Of a person
Just needed a fighting chance

David my perspective of partnership has changed since devotee
Divorce
Dance defiantly keeps me boant and happy
O know
But so did time with me
I think

Have friends that I can dance with socially makes me happy
You seemed to  enjoy what we had

I loved the dancing
I love poetry
I love the arts
You did not loke the love making, doing things together,  hanging on my lounge watching movies go out to see things together

I love to be moved with creative exspression
I thought i did that for you
My Poetry was my heart for you

I know
Tantra was my energy for you
Dance was my movement for you
Yoga was my desire to give to you
I mean i love yoga

I love a lot of things we did
And what you did for me
If you love so much
Hen why
I never tried to get into your family life
I knew my boundaries

I don't have time to hang out
I've also let you know that the time could reduce
I always gave you that power

I have an income to manage a son to care for mortgage.
You chose not to exercise it
I know
I  know you have to focus on your work
I am aware
But as a partner there are many ways i could help *not hinder)
Look its best not to continue this tonight. I don't want to suck your energy, i had too much fun with you on Wednesday at dance

I have to get back to painting
And i love you too much to drain you over and over

Yeah I need to keep to doing things that energise me just had a great walk at Balmoral in
Thats really good sunshine

I need to keep to things that energise me inspire me
Would you lije to do some photography with me tomorrow
Fir the luna

Good night
Im taking Seb out after I teach
Good night
good Night
I'm sorry, the rotunda statement just triggered me
I wish I could control my feelings around you

We have great times when we see each other Wednesday was so much fun.
Good night
Enjoy the moon

I love remembering the good times
But you love to pull of the bad times
I'll stop communicating my memories with you as it's obviously will be a different point of view .
I just need some time

So do I

Will you come dancing tonight?
I was not going too, but I would like to dance with you if you will dance with me?

Thank you
NOV 15TH, 12:01AM
Good night xo

Good night David ??xx
NOV 15TH, 7:52AM

David I was crying last night because I didn't want to hurt you but I don't want you to hurt me .
when you only pointed out all the things you had done and totally forgotten about all the things I had done for you. That hurt , I don't know why I put myself in a situation of abuse .I have always had an open heart with you and with every one in my life, because of this I have put myself In situations were I put up with emotional abuse and also and I am aware of a side to you now  that is quite toxic destructive manipulating and and abusive I'm not sure if I want to be a marter to that , I have only shown you love and caring and when you you haven't gotten your way in regards to the core of my reactions being for self care and protection I hate that our relationship is built on all or nothing I hate your negativity as you bring me down, love seems to be a commodity to barter with you.

I don't feel free with you
I'm feeling regret now
Have a wonderful day Julia, be a great mum, enjoy your work, love yourself, take notice of the small things, I wish you light, love and laughter.
Oh, BTW, your not my filler, 

You're my candle, the flickering light that I draw my eyes to, the flame of warm flow, the dance of magical energy, Firey inferno when given dry tinder, but soft and peaceful in the space of my heart.

Thank you David

I did love connecting with you, My heart is open to you . I had cleared my mind of you to a bearable amount so that I could focus on other parts off my life. I freaked out a bit as all I could think about was you and it annoyed me a little.
Anyway just did a video testimonial that whent absolutely amazing it brought a tear to my eye with the sincerity
People do love you
And they love what you do for their children

Thank you David I do love you and I will admit I had been thinking a lot about intimate connection with you in the last week
No regrets just a bit shitty that your invading my head space so much
Have a good day
Xo
haha
I'm glad there are no regrets
Have a good day
I'm sorry to invade your headspace

It's ok I'll deal with it
HAPPY FULL MOON IN TAURUS! Yes, we're bathing in the energies of the Super full moon in Taurus. So this is likely to: - amplify emotional situations, bringing any unresolved situations to a head - intensify feelings of anxiety / depression for those who are energetically sensitive - heighten urges to self-soothe with sensual pleasure, like comfort eating and sex - illuminate any issues round finances, property & possessions that have been hidden Full Moon in Taurus is likely to elicit our lessons in love. Why? Taurus is governed by Venus, the Roman name for the Goddess of Love. So if we've neglected to fill our cup of self-love with regular acts of kindness, tenderness and appreciation, this full moon we'll pine or wish for someone else to fill our cup for us. How? Adorning us with trinkets and affection, words of reassurance affirming how loveable & beautiful we are or action which proves we are the 'the fairest one of all'. All of this is narcissistic love. The desires of one who is emotionally immature. Alternatively, our lack of self love may show up as physical ailments since Taurus is an Earth sign. So if you've been comforting yourself with foods that appease your inner child but aren't really helpful to your body this is when your body is likely to ensure you put an end to that. Ultimately, self love is a practice - daily choices which reflect reverence, genuine care and respect for ourselves and our needs...something most of us know is important, but find it a challenge to ensure it remains a priority on a daily basis. Resources: For more info about the Super Moon energies we're now experiencing, here's the sneak peek version of my Full Moon Astro Oracle. http://bit.ly/2fFc33h I'm also excited to announce this Super Moon has inspired me to create a 21 day Self Love program! Stay tuned for more details. Blessings on your day, Tanishka

Here is a little poem that I wrote just before sleeping. Its short but was inspired by riding our bikes and watching your soft face in the moonlight glow
Soft glow and energy, 
The moon by her side.

This Empress flys on wind,
I'm near to her side.

She shines like the firefly, 
A light so brilliant, so bright.

A beacon of hope, she
Lights up darkest night.
NOV 16TH, 7:24AM

Good morning David, thank you for the poem , I slept so deep last night thankyou for helping squeeze out every last bit of energy in a positive way. If I had no salsa I would of gone nuts last night.

Ok, I'll do another, at another time
Julia
I just want you to know, that I will make some mistakes with you over the next few weeks (whether I like it or not), but I also want you to know that I am going to do my best to be a positive energy in your presences
I want you to leave me feeling energised
I hope you have a wonderful day and I look forward to just slow dancing kizoomba with you tonight

David I had a restless energy last night this is a time I know to keep a journaling
yeah, journaling is good for you, but also breath work

NOV 16TH, 8:48AM

I have to laugh, mum was asking where are the flowers, I said umm ahh , she said he's showing his true colours, I said yes.
she was not aware that we were not together?

She knows,  we don't talk about it, it's always been like that
Few words but just a knowing
I don't understand the true colors then?

She followed on to say we can all play pretend games
I don't say anything and even when I don't your still getting a hammering

call me

Don't call
ok,
will you call me soon?

NOV 18TH, 8:20AM

Take your swimmers
Will do
The kiss looks great

Kisses are always great
The sad story about that particular sculpture is based on two lovers having a secret affair and the man gets killed because when they are caught
Love is complicated, external influences can destroy personal affairs.
Well its a lovely sculpture
And a great way of describing intimate connection

Just did all the shopping and meeting went well. Now writing a blog
Which meeting?

Painting
She s happy
For the commision?

NOV 20TH, 6:50PM

Sorry just read above you always look after me I was meaning the change from my home life not from you.
I would love to give you a back cracking message
The nap reenergised me mums e course is. Doing well she has over six hundred views of her promo video and will be getting $45 for each person that signs on, really interesting to watch both Nina and mum and the difference with each of the platforms they chose to use
I'll share any insights with you as I know your interested in tapping into this market aswell xo
Thanks, very interested
And look forward to a massage from you
Heading home to zonk into bed i think
Good night
Xo

As soon as I got home I was buggered from drive also got sunburnt on my window arm
Sleep well my beautiful man

Coconut oil
Let's just use that instead of exspensive branded oils
Good idea

I think it's better as it doesn't get ransid
Sure

I would like to continue our tantra practice
I would live to have my empress back 8n my life and doing that sort of energy work with her

In regards to taking turns
I love giving and receiving messages backscratching even
Ha ha
Just because it's hard reach
Tapping
I'll do that more for you
As your a bit of a head case
With your work
I would love to receive those gifts from you
And yes i am a bit of a headcase

Your not a boy so how can I call you a boyfriend
Can I call you my partners
Partner
I could call you a boyfriend if you were 25 yrs old
But then I would be a cougar
Ha ha
What label would you like David?
That makes you feel important
Julia,  your my best friend, your my lover, your the person i share my most intimate experience with,  your the person I feel most alive with

Yes so what do we adresss each other as this should be a celebration not a trauma
I appreciate it that you want me to  feel important to you and you know that in itself means a lot to me

Our relationship has been mostly celebrations
Can i call you

Yes
NOV 20TH, 9:25PM

Just added you the grove group
Sorry the grove face book page
Anti clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, I was right!!
I know your right ??
Wink wink

Haha

Goodnight
Yep
Good night sweetheart xo,  you make me smile
NOV 21ST, 8:19AM

I love your naked soul

Wow who's the guy


Have a good day sweetheart, I wish light, love and laughter for you throughout the week
NOV 21ST, 12:53PM

You shared with me last night that you closed your eyes and visuals me at some other time during love making.when I close my eyes I have visuals of colour lights and stars
Just was thinking of that whilst painting
Have a great day
xo
NOV 21ST, 3:32PM
Hi Julia, how are you and how is your day?
NOV 21ST, 5:38PM

Feeling tired from the heat
How are you
Sone
Same
Just got home.  Bringing washing in
Doing another load
Hen might go into work and do something on resume

Yeah I did all that yesterday
And sheep skins
Hehe
Did they come good

Wool wash
All good done it before when Sebastian had acedents
No worries
Ok
Could rain tonight
Are you still dancing

I think I may skip dancing
I'm wanting to focus on my morning practice
The handstand man Nigel gave some great exercises
I'm including in my practice
Fair enough, i did a little practice this morning which was good for me. Stuff i learnt while away

I also hooked up with Julia
5 rites

We are going to jam together
?

No yoga instructor
She wants to jam with me
Not sure if I  met her
Jam?

She is the same size as me
Is that acro
That is the Saturday acro at shelly isn't it

Also has lots of experience in acro and yoga just getting back into it after a baby
Her husband will mind the baby whilst I jam with her
Sounds Sounds great

Yeah just want to learn some moves basing
Julia and Julia
Also after tropical sol finish I'm going to do a few classes with Nigel
Cool

It makes a difference to have instruction from a good teacher
Nigel has had some really amazing teachers and he's really cheap
He teaches Acro or is it part of the handstands

He teaches the more difficult poses
And all the exercises need to do to safly get into the pose
Safely
Is it something you want to do with me?
Or just on your own

I'll just do on my own
Ok

It will lend itself to reduce injury risk during acro
It's raining
Your washing
All in
2nd load i will put out tomorrow

Wanna
You want to chat
I'll call you in 5
Sure

NOV 21ST, 7:59PM
Just thinking about you Ms Julia and it brings a smile to my face when I think about the energy you project.

Thank you David
I had a big talk with my son tonight
Only just got him to bed
Hiw are things
Do you want to chat


I don't think my son is abnormal with his sexuality the best therapist is his mum and I'll be there for him to give him gudance I don't need to throw him to therapist sometimes it a group of women that can be the best help
Sounds practical

I don't think my sexual behaviour is abnormal eather it's not genetic
I don't think you should send him to therepist
Just wondering if there is someone you can talk to
Who has been there before
And i did not mean to imply about you
Sorry if it came across that way
NOV 21ST, 11:08PM

NOV 24TH, 11:11AM

Hope your well I'm going to LJ party on Saturday night
Would you like to join me
I would love to, but I may have a Rehab that I have to visit
I have to check my schedule
so I would be going after the Rehab
that probally will not effect my timing there, because it probally finishes around 8 anyway which is a good time to go to LJ
I'll let you know when I've checked my schedule
oh btw
congratulations on the invite by the Mayor

Yes really exciting, have a great day
you too

Got a few followers now on Snapchat, gotta get serious now with my posts??
Good work, posts look this mornings mayor accomplishment will really start to gain followers I believe

Just keep it art related
Yeah, niche focused, its partly why I'm not doing any thing yet
I have a niche that I want to do
but I'm not ready yet


This will be a good build up for e courses mums had over 14 k views on her video promoting her courses, because of her publicity with her residency and being affiliated with the North Sydney council, anyway gotta go t the launch
14K, brilliant
See ya


Xo

Oops 1400
its still a good number
NOV 24TH, 1:56PM

Your doing another tantric meet up
Just showing interest so that it reminds me
Its something i would only do with you if you are free
Saw something about it the other day but not sure when its on
I think it was pretty expensive but
Are you interested

Not really into it
Ok

Maybe if I was single
How was the trail

Haven't done it yet
It was the Launch speeches and talking with local council members artist
Really good
Ok excellent
I've just done yoga

Great I'll be going to more events like this especially
Seems good for networking and business development

If I apply for residency next year
Yes all round I'm making a. Video
In regards to the Tantra
I'm still working out in my head what a relationship is
I now what it means to connect
With someone like you and I
And I'm sure you could develope a similar level of healthy spiritual connection with the people that go to those meet up but they were all single
If I was single I would most probably go to one of those to explore Tantra
I'm not interested in tantra with you

Your not Intreasted?
Tantra is something I do for  my connection with you
My intimate partner
Not for connection to others
I love the lessons of tantra in my life

So why with the group

That whole conversation just stirred up a lot of things for me I need to reflect on this tonight feeling really agitated
Ok

Seems to always touch on the same thing repeatedly
I'll be at home tonight, if you want to chat then let me know

We are lovers
Not partners
That's the differ
I know you come back to that alot, I wish it were other wise, for me my heart pumps with love for you on a daily basis, and your in my mind at all times
for me you are my partner and while I may not be 100% perfect for you, I continue to hold you dear to my heart and strive to be a good man for you
I wish when I make mistakes, that they did not take a life of their own in your head
I wish you could just see my flaws, let me know that you are not happy with something and then just Let Go Let God
When you mentioned christmas eve dinner yesterday, my whole heart lept
Because I want to be more then your lover
I love being your lover, but your mean so much more to me then that

Let's talk about this tonight because it's fucking with my head again
ok
maybe you could do 5 rites?
I'll be at home after work, just let me know when later on

Ok
Sooner then later feeling really flat
I want to say that I love you and it distresses me when I feel you like this

Mum and John are out so I can't see you until after 9
ok
I will come to you around 9
and wait till your ready

That would be great it destress me, mums at the school were asking if I was ok
I'm so sorry, I create these feelings for you

It's a reaction from the trauma of divorce
I just wish I could heal your traumas

I'm guessing I have to teach a class now it's upsetting me that this is coming into my work
I don't want to be the one who brings this pain up in you
just breath some and talk to your higher power
maybe do a 10 x Gratitude list
they always help
NOV 24TH, 8:51PM
Piglet noticed that while he had a very small heart , it could hold a rather large amount of gratitude.

?
Im next door
I can wait
I know you probably can't come out yet

Yeah mums running late, sorry
I expected you would be late. No sorry needed

How are you
Grateful

I'm exhausted, the one morning I do t do my practice and I crash an burn
So unstable
It's fucked
Well there is a wonderful lesson for you
Self carw first
Care

Hmmm, it's like all of the unresolved thoughts or feelings about certain situations are in this massive ball that I still have to sort out it's like it's loaded into canon and sometimes the trigger is released and all of my fears and negative thoughts are shot into the back of my head I panic actually felt physically sick.
I can see it
Your still full of trauma

I know it's really exhausting
But on a giod note
Its coming out

Yes true
And you are in a safw place to let it out

I guess this the first time I'm feeling things as it happens
Dame it I'm not a machine
No your not,  but your  not perfect either
Live yourself
Love
Don't beat yourself up or have too high expectations about yourself
Acceptance is the answer

I just get into extreme paranoia
Ok so sit with  that

Things are more transparent with FB
How is that serving you today

It's not i cant control what you do
You can't control anyone

I know
And not everything that people do should be interpreted from your paradigm
We all have flawed, skewed perspectives

Yes I'm still working out how to be
Yeah
We all are
Its part of the journey
But generally
You are doing exceptionally well

It's strange my social life and my parenting life is so different
I don't know
You have a 5 year old in both camps


Hmm
Haha

True
But in bith camps
Is someone who lives you for who you are
Loves
I love you Julia for who who you are. Including your insecurities
Its why I am in gratitude tonight

I don't like having seperate camps
I know

I find it hard
It makes things really really hard
And it hurts
But it is where your at
And that's where my acceptance lives
Do you know
You are 40 and i am nearly 45
We easily have 40 to 60 years in us if we look after ourselves
There is a spark, no a light,  scratch that a blazing flame that i see in you
This last 8 months is a small period of time, I am so happy to be patient with us

How do you see us in the future?
Because i know that there is so much beauty that could be explored between us
I don't look at it with auch limitations Julia
Every day i live in gratitude and wonder at how we are together.  I guess I live in the beautiful  moments

You said you are patient for what to happen
Is that my mum
Yes
You know all the experiences that you and i have gone through this year
With each of them i have grown as a man, as a human, as a child of light
You have too
The journey has been the reward
Its what i am patient for
Last night all we did was go for a quick dabce and a ride home

Ok I'm coming out where are you
You know, last night was one of the best nights of the year fir me
Car park

Ok
NOV 24TH, 11:32PM
Are you there
The messages were from my son Steven
Looks like he finally got to see his son
NOV 25TH, 6:48AM

That's wonderful David, what an intense moment for him.
It will makes shifts in his life
Thank you for last night
I spoke on phone with him
I could feel the shift
Have a good day sweetheart xo

I just finished my practice I'm looking forward to looking After you tonight in a place of strength xo

Cute xo
My body and mind shifts into a higher vibration after each practice it's an essential part of my well being
Xo
I love you David

Thank you
NOV 25TH, 8:45AM

The moon is still waning in Libra so this highlights our patterns of relating. So this is a good time to consider the relationships we have in our life which are harmonious & ask, 'What dynamics contribute to this sense of mutual harmony?' Often these will be our friendships. Why? Friends are those who we feel aligned with in our values. There are less expectations with friends than we have with our intimate partners, since we don't usually live with them or have shared finances, so our survival issues don't get triggered. The best friendships have an even amount of give & take. So both feel equally heard & supported through life's ups and downs. A true friend will always affirm our greatest strengths so when we forget them, they remind us. Friends are a constant, when partnerships come & go. However, the best partnerships are built on a solid foundation of friendship. So do whatever your intuition urges you to do today to nurture the spirit of friendship in your life. You may like to share this post with a friend who gifts you this kind of support to let them know how much you appreciate & value them. Blessings on your day, Tanishka
The Moon Woman
Good read, thanks for the appreciation
I love the bit about survival issues getting triggered
YOU ARE [the people you spend time with, the conversations you engage in, the energy you spend time with]
I am grateful for your time, your conversation, your energy

Xo
NOV 25TH, 12:17PM
Hi Beautiful, I just had a quick look at snapchat and I was inspired to write you a quick little poem
This is for You Julia
10 seconds of snap, her life it unfolds,
I watch from the chat, the princess of gold.

My heart is a flutter, as she talks of her day,
With glow from her eyes, like soft moonlight ray.

The world broken down to the millionth colour,
The power collected from earth, thy mother.

She paints from the heart, from her living dreams,
With prisms of light, with energy streams.

Wise like the wolf, strength of the lion,
From the power of queens, she’s the energy scion.

Turning back to my day, my life is in bliss,
tonight, I will see and those lips I will kiss.

Stunning!! that's one to get painted xo
xo

Just photographed it
NOV 26TH, 6:58AM

Have a beautiful morning xo

I found that the following intimate connection was more powerful
Is it something you can do while out and about
Car ir park

Haha

But something

I do the practice for myself and will enjoy sharing with you when the time and place is good
I think reiki is mor comfortable on a towel or bed
Breath and ons in the park

No beach to cold, going to see trolls the movie instead. Have a great day xo

We're now in the darkest lunar days in Scorpio...so you may feel a tad reclusive despite the festive season commencing. Scorpio really brings everything that's been hidden out into the open...exposing all that has been sabotaging us, such as toxic thoughts, feelings, behaviours, deceit or unethical conduct. So whilst dark moon in Scorpio can be a time of challenging crises, remember this is the dark before the dawn & only by confronting what is poisoning us can we begin the healing process & transmute the poison. The Sun is currently in Sag which is very much about identifying our direction in life. So as we approach new moon when both the Sun & moon will be in Sag, many may be questioning the path they're on & even the path they've walked. This will be especially pronounced for anyone navigating the years around 49...which is when Chiron returns to confront us with our greatest wound. Chiron, is the archetypal healer - a Centaur who is evoked during lunar transits through Sag whose symbol is the centaur. Whatever your age, this is a good day to contemplate how your greatest perceived failures have gifted you your greatest understandings which you can use to assist others. In a culture which places value on outer proof of worth rather than inner wisdom, it is important we value ourselves according to our inner perception rather than societal projections.

Just doing my breath work at observatory hill and was reflecting on my gratitudes and I am very grateful that always have this positive health focused attitude to life. 

It is powerful to be around energy that is always living in life and vitality.

Good morning David yes and I would like to be of service to share this with people.
Have a great day xo
NOV 28TH, 11:02AM

Sebastian had a meltdown at graduation, big sobbing tears before during and after I think the underlying cause was divorce trauma . I brought him home did A full body reki he responded so well and now sending him back to school, I'll do this for him three times a week until he has recovered. It was good for him to have a big sob to release everything, part of the healing process.
Whats really good is that you have the skills to heal
I'm glad he was able to release some of that physical trauma
It was a lovely picture of you and him this morning, your really peaceful and glowing in that photo
How is your trauma?
I mean when you go through that with Sebastian

Mum is no help she said some remark that it was my fault he's crying like that, i was going to fight back but realised that would of been a victims approach in the heat of the moment, so I ignored him Peter on the other hand was really great and supportive we worked together chatting to him
Its really great that you and Peter have a good relationship regarding your son, something to be really grateful for
Also good to hear that you did not react to your mum

M is defiantly not a crone she still has a lot to learn to be initiated to that
Maybe, she still has lots of wisdom, but maybe not in this area
Your own strength and wisdom is all you need here

Yes all the more reason I look forward to Sebastian and I living in our own sacred space
Yeah
Grandparents should be grandparents
its what they are good at
Have you had a chance to do a practice for youself, after this incident?
5 Rights, or Breath

Thank you aswell in regards to realising the  health side of crying I communicated all of this to Sebastian not to feel ashamed that he crude and also spoke about good energy and bad energy, we will do more work together on this gradually over the next few weeks
Have you watched the Man Up show with him?

I did all of my practices this morning I think things would of been a lot worse as I would of panicked and acted in fear
No not on his age level
I'm just thinking it might still be good to do a 10 minute practice now
just to clear and center

I'll just continue to do reki the difference before and after was massive
Ok
I'm really proud of you Julia

Yes true especially in how to talk to mum
I'll do it now and get on with painting have a great day xx
You too sweetheart
xo

Much calmer now, so incredible, to be able to tap into higher frequencies, love it.

Good night sunshine
xo

Buy
Just in the middle of bathing Seb
Our lives are so different
It it's been nice being your friend
I know

Iv been focusing on my future
And adapting my life
I know

What I feel happy with
I can read you like a book

Peter was able to fix the car
We are also better as friends
Im happy for you

I need friends family
Yep

Relationship  can kill a friendships
And whilst I'm transitioning
You really don't need to continue justifying anything

I'm going to be under more stress
Like i said I can read you like a book

Great i letting go
I'm letting go
You've been doing that for months

I can't do casual
I rather do nothing
Regarding relationship
I now now connection with Tantra and spiritual is far stronger than intercourse
I'm wanting to serve
Spiritualy
Spiritually
For many
Connect with many
Share
You will be great in your path

We are the same
You already serve many
And you will continue to do so well
I know i will
It's unfortunate that you never explored the power of synergy with me

I had a vision of yo a man traveling with his laptop and dance shoes and not much else.
Serving people
We are so different
Our lifestyle
I don't like the mystery
If I'm not with you sexually I don't care who your with
I find it is a weight on my mind
My spirit
Even as lovers with nothing else

I feel lighter and I don't want a relationship based on pitty
I would never have been with someone else
That's been a fear that you have never had to live in, in regards to me
But unfortunately that has never been a relief to you

I have to go son to bedtime

My relief has been my freedom
My relief has been my adventure
My relief has been meninful connections
My relief has been my spiritual path
My relief has been discovering a new relationship with my ex husband that is healthy
My relief has been discovery new places new sanctuary for my son and I to play in
My relief is knowing I have a future that is so amazing so beautiful it catches my breath
My relief is trusting my intuition even when it seems like the harder path I know with all my heart I'm being looked after.
I had a vision this morning
Massive shifts
TUE 9:31PM
There is something in your letter bix for you

David
Yes

Close
Or gone
Gone

Ok I just was in meditation
Which is probably best

And journaling
I need to go through anitiation
I need to transition alone
I need to be scared to grow
I can do this buy myself
I will feel I have better for it
Thank you for the purple something in the post

But also what I told you I hope you listen to otherwise I'm going to fucking ground you
Haha
Yes
I will
Gitta go
Aa call

Also I think a lot off what people say to each other is a reflection of there own co concerns
I'm there personal life
In
I'm not totally clear what I'm finding in a partner because I'm having to change everything that I thought was right for me. Have a good day
SAT 12:37PM
Hi Julia, wishing you a great day. 

I've had a big night. Only got sleep between 3 and 5 but quite  energised as it was really interesting the the diverse nature of the calls i received. I was still receiving calls when you messaged me this morning and this is the first time I've had a chance to raise my head for air. 

 I'm at Kiz workshops and they have been awesome, especially Gen and Andy who did more of their flow technique. 

I wanted to say that I really appreciated the nature of our conversation last night, the fire and heat had its palce and it was healing and useful for me in some way as well as being energetic which was great.

I do want apologize for the couple of times I was crude with you, such as out front of my house. sorry for that.

As to your last comment about grounding me and the reasons you would go there, I would really appreciate the spotlight being shone by you on my delusions,  I am aware of then, but I don't necessarily have good solutions and, I don't want to live life in them, especially the financial ones and I trully trust your judgement around that.

Im so grateful you are my friend and I love you for that. 

You are an extraordinary woman Julia and areal light in my life. 

I hope your back is ok.

Have a great day fierce wolf xo
SAT 3:12PM

It's messages like this the communication that amaze me about you and the encouragement you give me In making me feel good about myself in aspects of appearance your poetry about my stages of healing in life. 
I listen to you and seriously take on board and work with the advice you give me, your words are not wasted on me ever!!
I have put into action all of your advise for my work And also phycological advice. 
You are and have been an incredible enriching person for my life. 
Single life will be the time of deeper healing me and I need that time, to explore what I really want in a partner and I'll take on being open to finding a partner when I have worked through all my traumas as I want my next partner to be for life Somone I can keep growing with,
don't get me wrong I love partnership, that's why I have been in one all of my life but have tended to of played a roll of servicing to there needs more and not my own need as much, not there fault but mine for not totally understand what I wanted in a life partner.
Now I have most things in place that radiates my days with joy, family. work, home.
My ex husband was  an underwear model, highly intelligent sociable ect incredible man when I met him, plenty of girls used to hit on him and I sacrificed so much to becon him to choose me as the one to stay with and marry, I remember  i so happy to do anything for him as he was choosing me  to live with I did all the cooking and the cleaning we went halves on everything so I didn't cost him anything I sold my appartments so that we had a healthy deposit for a new family home We even lived at my parents home southat we could save moresupported him when he had a motorcycle accident that had him bed for 6 months I worked extra shifts to cover our costs I put up with his alcoholic friend living with us, I put up when I was pregnant peter lost his job and started building a car, one of his passions not mine I had to take on extra shifts and I started to develop Art Box Workshops.
Peter still didn't have work when Sebastian was born and my parent loaned us money after I had the baby it was horrible and stressful for me and I went back to work aswell as kept developing art Box Workshops aswell as John started mentioning peter to get a job , he finally got one and then when I communicated that I wanted time to focus just on Art Box Workshops and cut back on my shift work he didn't support me with that decision not only that I had to pay for all of Sebastians day care if I wanted to work on my business, I share with you this story because 
Finances have been a massive stress in my life with my ex and it's something I want to avoid with my future partner.
I'm not surprised you have women hitting on you, your an amazing man but I now through my life lessons that I would much rather be single and self sufficient I'm not desperate to get me a man. 
I'm not desperate anymore, I'm working on a position of strength so I walk draw and attract the right man to me in mutual companionship.
Enjoy your dancing .

Just had a nana nap and heading to acro

MON 7:59AM
She looked like art, and art wasn’t supposed to look nice, it was supposed to make you feel something.

Good morning David thank you for sharing a memorable Sunday with me. Have a great day
You too
MON 1:29PM

Thinking of going to the Ox social
Didn't get a good enough fill of kiz yesterday
I'll zip in for an hour or so i would love a dance if your going
Actually I won't be able to get there tonight
I hope you enjoy the dancing

Not a problem have a good night
MON 8:23PM
I will have to give thought to your comment


That's good. Big storm coming in . ?
How are you princess

I'm listening to Nina Simon a singer that moves me
How are you?
Izabella had some beautiful words to share from last night
Really
How was she with last night

She saw your devotion to me as being palpable, and loved the poem
She is norlt aware that we are separated is she

Michael Mur has an interesting point of view in regards to relationships , sometimes I feel like I've been indoctrinated into a certain view of how relationships are and it's what brings up the fear
I'm trying to learn and see new ways
Let go
Et gid
Let god

Well we we're together last night
Weren't we
Yes we were
As connected as ever
I thought later about whether i had planned the kiss
And I  hadn't really
It kind of seemed like a natural extension of the night

It was a beautiful moment
All moments that I have with you are beautiful

My heart was fluttering and I felt scared
Spending the hour before we sat at the sculpture was wonderful
I know you feel scared

One of the things they spoke about at the awakening talk
Was to take notice of your body's reactions  to situations
I do think of you a lot
And the way you make me feel
Feeling of unease is a good thing fear is a good thing
It makes you grow by facing and overcoming your fears, like Singing
When Isabela says that my devotion to you is papable, I know for myself that my love fir grows with time, I've never had that before.  For me it is always a lessoning of fealings
But with you it only ever increases

I'm really happy that at least one family member has witnessed our connection
I do love you and really enjoyed our connection yesterday

I have to get back to work.
Have a good night
MON 10:21PM

Your words are truly magical
No they are just mere reflections of real beauty. Simple facsimiles of the light I see in you Julia

You give me bliss David, good night xx
Good night Julia
Sleep in the white dreams if your beautiful heart
xo

I just want to record this into our time line, even though it is not really a poem
She looked like art, a thousand brush strokes of raw emotion, a soul with more dancing light than the San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk, rich curves best visualized in the negative spaces, a perfect symbiosis of romantic connection that only Picasso's "Femme nue dans un fauteuil rouge" could capture, Nina Simone would simply say "she'd put a spell on you" and a thousand Monet's would would have less value then one of her smiles.

Why?
What are you doing with our time line?
I mean here
I just put it into this chat box

Your not working me like one of the million courses you do and systems you learn.
To test what works ?
Julia, are you in a anixious, fearful or some other sort of place right now?

I'm just woundering how many chat lines your working
Yuk
Sometimes you suck Julia, you go into this place of thinking I'm some sort of a player or manipulator which I'm not
You go into this space, of accusation and fear and its unfounded

No I want you to answer my question
I don't have multiple chat lines going,

Why do you need to have everything recorded in our chat line
I have one chat line to you
Well, my plan was to create a gift for you for your birthday next year, which is meant to be a surprise
but I can't have surprises with you because you think anything I'm doing that is a little secretive is done from dark ness
it's like 3 weeks ago when I went over sysdney to make you something for christmass
but you go into this place of darkeness about what I might be doing
why do you always go there

Its my fucking personal life don't use it
ok, forget it, bywe

And don't use it especially when It been a time in my life at my most fucking vulnerable you don't gift that to someone
When you go to counciling or AA do they record everything
It is having that trust of Be ing able to communicate with someone and to let it go
Not to hold onto it an gift it
I do my personal journaling
I broke up with you once before
I'm so sick and tired of being loving and acting from a place of love and kindness too you and having you alway spit in my face.

This journal here (has not been your journal) it has been our journal.

This journal here has never been shared with anyone, because it is our journal.

In regards to using what we communicate
Just bugger off if you are going to continue to think badly of me

And your still fucking using it
I'm so sick of you living in fear and ungratitude
just fuck off

No understanding of boundaries creates toxic emotions
just stop talkng to me
I don't want to talk any more, I'm tired of being treated like crap

And yes you fucking triggered it because you don't listen to my boundaries
You don't listen to my boundaries David
I have not broken a boundary, I have shared a simple message in our shared chat client and you have gone into a fucking spiral over nothing
there is no boundary problem here, there is a fear problem

Then listen to me
but just stop talking to me, I have had enough of your self centered fears

I've been upset  before and I am now
you always are upset, thats your place of comfort
you will take the smallest things and turn them into mountains, I can't continue to be the brunt of your anger
leave me alone

No David I'm not I have just put my trust with my private and deepest feelings during a time of recovery with the wrong person
I've never broken your trust, so bugger off

I have said don't use this transcript before
Haven't I and your using it
Have I used, it no

You don't listen to my wishes
And I will go away
but I thought a nice little diary of poems and beautiful statments for you birthday would havbe been a lovely present
but I'm wrong
its ok

From you as your breaking my heart
I won't continue to be nice to someone who keeps pissing on me

And I won't be with someone that has no concept of boundaries and refuses to listen to them
sure, your not with someone like that
bugger off

Your such a child
I'm just tired, I've having you beat the shit out of me over your issues
I have to find my own self respect and put an end to your crap
