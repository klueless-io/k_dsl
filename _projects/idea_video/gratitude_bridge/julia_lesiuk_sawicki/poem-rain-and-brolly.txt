I leave my home this rainy night
With splattter gleames from soft streetlight.

Walking under light blue brolly
My heart is joy, my heart is jolly.

For in my mind I see this girl.
The lady leaves my heart a swirl

For perfect is this diamond, Julia
Heaven shaped, by an angel jeweler

And as i start to end this poem,
A message comes from her by phone

She tells me of her day of fun,
Her accomplishments, her loving son.

And now she travels for a night of dance.
I'll leave these words of warm romance

In message chat, for thats my style
Cause when she sees this, I'll feel her smile
