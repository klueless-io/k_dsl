# builder-root

The root folder in a project is the folder that all other folders sit under.

Generally this folder will not have anything in it except for the sub folders to other projects.

The one exception is that there is a .builders folder that is used to build the other project folders.

This folder may also have some miscellaneous files such as readme, enterprise configuration or other cross cutting files
