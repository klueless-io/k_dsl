KDSL is a DSL builder that uses natural language constructs and applies an MVC pattern to produce SloCode

KDSL follows the MVC pattern for producing code.

The model folder contains DSLS for producing documents with multiple setting groups and tables

As a Developer, I should be able to implement a flexible DSL quickly, so that I build my own Domain Language

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
